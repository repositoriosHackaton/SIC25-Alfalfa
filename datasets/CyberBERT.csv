Data Security GoTo Best Practices Get the straightforward guide that makes protecting your data feel effortless and simplified. Strengthen your cloud data security with these essential best practices.
"Cyber Threats Cybersecurity Welcome to this weeks Cybersecurity News Recap. Discover how cyber attackers are using clever tricks like fake codes and sneaky emails to gain access to sensitive data. We cover everything from device code phishing to cloud exploits, breaking down the technical details into simple, easytofollow insights. Threat of the Week Russian Threat Actors Leverage Device Code Phishing to Hack Microsoft Accounts Microsoft and Volexity have revealed that threat actors with ties to Russia are leveraging a technique known as device code phishing to gain unauthorized access to victim accounts, and use that access to get hold of sensitive data and enable persistent access to the victim environment. At least three different Russialinked clusters have been identified abusing the technique to date. The attacks entail sending phishing emails that masquerade as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations, which, when clicked, urge the message recipients to authenticate using a threat actorgenerated device code, thereby allowing the adversary to hijack the authenticated session using the valid access token. Stop Playing The Hackers Game Their Way Its time for a new security approach. Replace traditional security technology that exposes your attack surface and allows lateral movement to access your data. Upgrade Security Now Top News whoAMI Attack Exploits AWS AMI Name Confusion for Remote Code Execution A new type of name confusion attack called whoAMI allows anyone who publishes an Amazon Machine Image AMI with a specific name to gain code execution within the Amazon Web Services AWS account. Datadog, which detailed the attack, said roughly 1 of organizations monitored by the company were affected by the whoAMI, and that it found public examples of code written in Python, Go, Java, Terraform, Pulumi, and Bash shell using the vulnerable criteria. AWS told The Hacker News that there is no evidence of malicious exploitation of the security weakness. RansomHub Targets Over 600 Orgs Globally The RansomHub ransomware operation has targeted over 600 organizations across the world , spanning sectors such as healthcare, finance, government, and critical infrastructure, making it one of the most active cybercrime groups in 2024. One such attack has been found to weaponize nowpatched security flaws in Microsoft Active Directory and the Netlogon protocol to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to a victim networks domain controller as part of their postcompromise strategy. REF7707 Uses Outlook Drafts for CommandandControl A previously undocumented threat activity cluster dubbed REF7707 has been observed using a remote administration tool named FINALDRAFT that parses commands stored in the mailboxs drafts folder and writes the results of the execution into new draft emails for each command. It makes use of the Outlook email service via the Microsoft Graph API for commandandcontrol C2 purposes. The group has been observed targeting the foreign ministry of an unnamed South American nation, as well as a telecommunications entity and a university, both located in Southeast Asia. Kimsuky Embraces ClickFixStyle Attack Strategy The North Korean threat actor known as Kimsuky aka Black Banshee is using a new tactic that involves deceiving targets into running PowerShell as an administrator and then instructing them to paste and run malicious code provided by them. To execute this tactic, the threat actor masquerades as a South Korean government official and over time builds rapport with a target before sending a spearphishing email with an sic PDF attachment, Microsoft said. Users are then convinced to click on a URL, urging them to register their device in order to read the PDF attachment. The end goal of the attack is to establish a data communication mechanism that allows the adversary to exfiltrate data. Law Enforcement Op Takes Down 8Base A consortium of law enforcement agencies has arrested four Russian nationals and seized over 100 servers linked to the 8Base ransomware gang. The arrests were made in Thailand. Two of the suspects are accused of operating a cybercrime group that used Phobos ransomware to victimize more than 1,000 public and private entities in the country and across the world. The development comes in the aftermath of a series of highprofile ransomware disruptions associated with Hive, LockBit, and BlackCat in recent years. Late last year, Evgenii Ptitsyn, a 42yearold Russian national believed to be the administrator of the Phobos ransomware, was extradited to the U.S. Trending CVEs Your goto software could be hiding dangerous security flawsdont wait until its too late!

Around the Cyber World Former Google Engineer Charged with Plan to Steal Trade Secrets Linwei Ding, a former Google engineer who was arrested last March for transferring sensitive Google trade secrets and other confidential information from Googles network to his personal account, has now been charged with seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets related to the companys AI technology between 2022 and 2023. This included detailed information about the architecture and functionality of Googles Tensor Processing Unit TPU chips and systems and Graphics Processing Unit GPU systems, the software that allows the chips to communicate and execute tasks, and the software that orchestrates thousands of chips into a supercomputer capable of training and executing cuttingedge AI workloads. The trade secrets also relate to Googles customdesigned SmartNIC, a type of network interface card used to enhance Googles GPU, high performance, and cloud networking products. Ding intended to benefit the PRC government by stealing trade secrets from Google, the U.S. Department of Justice said . Ding allegedly stole technology relating to the hardware infrastructure and software platform that allows Googles supercomputing data center to train and serve large AI models. The superseding indictment also stated that Chinesesponsored talent programs incentivize individuals engaged in research and development outside the country to transmit such information in exchange for salaries, research funds, lab space, or other incentives. If convicted, Ding faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and up to a 250,000 fine for each tradesecret count and 15 years in prison and a 5,000,000 fine for each economic espionage count. Windows UI Flaw Exploited by Mustang Panda Israeli cybersecurity company ClearSky has warned that a suspected Chinese nationstate group known as Mustang Panda is actively exploiting a UI vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. When files are extracted from compressed RAR files they are hidden from the user, the company said . If the compressed files are extracted into a folder, the folder appears empty in the Windows Explorer GUI. When using the dir command to list all files and folders inside the target folder, the extracted files and folders are invisiblehidden to the user. Threat actors or users can also execute those compressed files from a command line prompt, if they know the exact path. As a result of executing attrib s h to system protected files, an unknown file type is created from the type Unknown ActiveX component. Its currently not clear who are the targets of the attack, and what the end goals of the campaign are. When reached for comment, Microsoft said it did not have anything to share at this time. Meta Paid Over 2.3M in Bug Bounty Rewards in 2024 Meta said it paid out more than 2.3 million in rewards to nearly 200 security researchers as part of its bug bounty program in 2024. In total, the company has handed out more than 20 million since the creation of the program in 2011. The top three countries based on bounties awarded in 2024 are India, Nepal, and the United States. Critical ThinkPHP and OwnCloud Flaws Under Active Exploitation Threat actors are attempting to actively exploit two known security vulnerabilities impacting ThinkPHP CVE202247945, CVSS score 9.8 and OwnCloud CVE202349103, CVSS score 10.0 over the past few days, with attacks originating from hundreds of unique IP addresses, most of which are based in Germany, China, the U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Canada. Organizations are recommended to apply the necessary patches ThinkPHP to 6.0.14 and ownCloud GraphAPI to 0.3.1 and restrict access to reduce the attack surface. FSB Mole Arrested in Ukraine The Secret Service of Ukraine SSU said it had detained one of its own highlevel officials, accusing them of acting as a mole for Russia. The individual, one of the officials of the SSU Counterterrorism Center, is alleged to have been recruited by Russias Federal Security Service FSB in Vienna in 2018, and actively began engaging in espionage at the end of December last year, transmitting documents containing state secrets, to the intelligence agency via a special mobile phone. The SSU, upon learning of the mans actions, said it used him in a counterintelligence game through the traitor the SSU fed the enemy a large amount of disinformation. The individuals name was not disclosed, but the Kyiv Independent said its Colonel Dmytro Kozyura, citing unnamed SSU sources. LLMjacking Hits DeepSeek Malicious actors have been observed capitalizing on the popularity of AI chatbot platform DeepSeek to conduct whats called LLMjacking attacks that involve selling the access obtained to legitimate cloud environments to other actors for a price. These attacks involve the use of stolen credentials to allow access to machine learning services via the OpenAI Reverse Proxy ORP, which acts as a reverse proxy server for LLMs of various providers. The ORP operators hide their IP addresses using TryCloudflare tunnels . Ultimately, the illicit LLM access is used to generate NSFW content, and malicious scripts, and even circumvent bans on ChatGPT in countries like China and Russia, where the service is blocked. Cloudbased LLM usage costs can be staggering, surpassing several hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly, Sysdig said . The high cost of LLMs is the reason cybercriminals choose to steal credentials rather than pay for LLM services. Due to steep costs, a black market for access has developed around OAI Reverse Proxies and underground service providers have risen to meet the needs of consumers. Romance Baiting Scams Jump 40 YoY Pig butchering scams , also called romance baiting, have accounted for 33.2 of the estimated 9.9 billion revenue earned by cybercriminals in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams, growing nearly 40 yearoveryear. However, the average deposit amount to pig butchering scams declined 55 YoY, likely indicating a shift in how these scams are conducted. Pig butchering scammers have also evolved to diversify their business model beyond the long con of pig butchering scams which can take months and even years of developing a relationship before receiving victim payments to quicker turnaround employment or workfromhome scams that typically yield smaller victim deposits, Chainalysis said . Further analysis of onchain activity has found that HuiOne Guarantee is heavily used for illicit cryptobased activities supporting the pig butchering industry in Southeast Asia. Scammers have also been observed using generative AI technology to facilitate crypto scams, often to impersonate others or generate realistic content. Security Issues in RedNote Flagged Its not just DeepSeek. A new network security analysis undertaken by the Citizen Lab has uncovered multiple issues in RedNotes aka Xiaohongshu Android and iOS apps. This includes fetching viewed images and videos over HTTP, transmitting insufficiently encrypted device metadata, as well as a vulnerability that enables network attackers to learn the contents of any files that RedNote has permission to read on the users devices. While the second vulnerability was introduced by an upstream analytics SDK, MobTech, the third issue was introduced by NEXTDATA. As of writing, all the flaws remain unpatched. The vulnerabilities could enable surveillance by any government or ISP, and not just the Chinese government, the Citizen Lab said . CISA Urges Orgs to Address Buffer Overflows The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA and Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI have released a Secure by Design Alert, urging organizations to eliminate buffer overflow vulnerabilities in software. These vulnerabilities can lead to data corruption, sensitive data exposure, program crashes, and unauthorized code execution, the agencies said , labeling them as unforgivable defects. Threat actors frequently exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to an organizations network and then move laterally to the wider network. Saeed Abbasi, manager of vulnerability research at Qualys Threat Research Unit TRU, emphasized the need to switch from memory unsafe languages. Legacy excuses are out the world has zero tolerance for memoryunsafe code in 2025, Abbasi said. Yes, rewriting old systems is daunting, but letting attackers exploit decadesold buffer overflows is worse. Organizations still clinging to unsafe languages risk turning minor vulnerabilities into massive breachesand they cant claim surprise. Weve had proven fixes for ages phased transitions to Rust or other memorysafe options, compilerlevel safeguards, thorough adversarial testing, and public commitments to a securebydesign roadmap. The real challenge is collective will leadership must demand memorysafe transitions, and software buyers must hold vendors accountable. Foreign Adversaries Target Local Communities in the U.S. for Influence Ops A new report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy ASD has found that foreign nationstate actors from Russia, China, and Iran are running influence operations that exploit trust in local sources and impact state and local communities in the U.S. with an aim to manipulate public opinion, stoke discord, and undermine democratic institutions. In some cases, adversarial nations seek favorable outcomes around local policy issues in others, they use local debates as Trojan horses to advance their broader geopolitical agendas, the research said . Russia emerged as the most active threat actor, with 26 documented cases designed to polarize Americans through themes related to immigration and election integrity. Beijing, on the other hand, sought to cultivate support for Chinese state interests. Financial Orgs Asked to Switch to QuantumSafe Cryptography Europol is urging financial institutions and policymakers to transition to quantumsafe cryptography , citing an imminent threat to cryptographic security due to the rapid advancement of quantum computing. The primary risk is that threat actors could steal encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it in the future using quantum computing, a technique called harvest now, decrypt later or retrospective decryption. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer has the potential to break widely used publickey cryptographic algorithms, endangering the confidentiality of financial transactions, authentication processes, and digital contracts, the agency said . While estimates suggest that quantum computers capable of such threats could emerge within the next 10 to 15 years, the time required to transition away from vulnerable cryptographic methods is significant. A successful transition to postquantum cryptography requires collaboration among financial institutions, technology providers, policymakers, and regulators. Last year, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST formally announced the first three quantumsafe algorithms. Google Addresses High Impact Flaws Google has addressed a pair of security flaws that could be chained by malicious actors to unmask the email address of any YouTube channel owners email address. The first of the two is a vulnerability identified in a YouTube API that could leak a users GAIA ID , a unique identifier used by Google to manage accounts across its network of sites. This ID could then be fed as input to an outdated web API associated with Pixel Recorder to convert it into an email when sharing a recording. Following responsible disclosure on , the issues were resolved as of . There is no evidence that these shortcomings were ever abused in the wild. New DoJ Actions Target Crypto Fraud Eric Council Jr., 25, of Alabama, has pleaded guilty to charges related to the January 2024 hacking of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions SEC X account. The account was taken over to falsely announce that the SEC approved BTC Exchange Traded Funds, causing a spike in the price of bitcoin. The attack was carried out through an unauthorized Subscriber Identity Module SIM swap carried out by the defendant, tricking a mobile phone provider store to reassign the victims phone number to a SIM card in their possession using a fraudulent identity card printed using an ID card printer. Council, who was arrested in December 2024, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. In a related development, a 22yearold man from Indiana, Evan Frederick Light, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for running a massive cryptocurrency theft scheme from his mothers basement. Light broke into an investment holdings company in South Dakota in February 2022, stealing customers personal data and cryptocurrency worth over 37 million from nearly 600 victims. The stolen cryptocurrency was then funneled to various locations throughout the world, including several mixing services and gambling websites to conceal his identity and to hide the virtual currency. Separately, the Justice Department has also charged Canadian national Andean Medjedovic, 22, for exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities in two decentralized finance crypto platforms, KyberSwap and Indexed Finance, to fraudulently obtain about 65 million from the protocols investors between 2021 and 2023. A masters degree holder in mathematics from the University of Waterloo, Medjedovic is also alleged to have laundered the proceeds through mixers and bridge transactions in an attempt to conceal the source and ownership of the funds. Medjedovic is charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of unauthorized damage to a protected computer, one count of attempted Hobbs Act extortion, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and one count of money laundering. He faces over 30 years in prison. U.S. Lawmakers Warn Against U.K. Order for Backdoor to Apple Data After reports emerged that security officials in the U.K. have ordered Apple to create a backdoor to access any Apple users iCloud content, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Member of Congress Andy Biggs have sent a letter to Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, urging the U.K. to retract its order, citing it threatens the privacy and security of both the American people and the U.S. government. If the U.K. does not immediately reverse this dangerous effort, we urge you to reevaluate U.S.U.K. cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as U.S. intelligence sharing with the U.K., they added. The purported Apple backdoor request would reportedly allow authorities to access data currently secured by Advanced Data Protection, potentially affecting users worldwide . Wyden has also released a draft version of the Global Trust in American Online Services Act that seeks to secure Americans communications against abusive foreign demands to weaken the security of communications services and software used by Americans. While the security experts have criticized the order, British officials have neither confirmed nor denied it.

Tip of the Week Segment Your WiFi Network for Better Protection In todays smart home, you likely have many connected devicesfrom laptops and smartphones to smart TVs and various IoT gadgets. When all these devices share the same WiFi network, a breach in one device could potentially put your entire network at risk. Home network segmentation helps protect you by dividing your network into separate parts, similar to how large businesses isolate sensitive information. To set this up, use your routers guest network or VLAN features to create different SSIDs, such as Home_Private for personal devices and Home_IoT for smart gadgets. Ensure each network uses strong encryption WPA3 or WPA2 with unique passwords, and configure your router so devices on one network cannot communicate with those on another. Test your setup by connecting your devices accordingly and verifying that crossnetwork traffic is blocked, then periodically check your routers dashboard to keep the configuration working smoothly. Conclusion That wraps up this weeks cybersecurity news. Weve covered a broad range of storiesfrom the case of a former Google engineer charged with stealing key AI secrets to hackers taking advantage of a Windows user interface flaw. Weve also seen how cybercriminals are moving into new areas like AI misuse and cryptocurrency scams, while law enforcement and industry experts work hard to catch up. These headlines remind us that cyber threats come in many forms, and every day, new risks emerge that can affect everyone from large organizations to individual users. Keep an eye on these developments and take steps to protect your digital life. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to keeping you informed next week. Found this article interesting?

"Website Security Vulnerability A crosssite scripting XSS vulnerability in a virtual tour framework has been weaponized by malicious actors to inject malicious scripts across hundreds of websites with the goal of manipulating search results and fueling a spam ads campaign at scale. Security researcher Oleg Zaytsev, in a report shared with The Hacker News, said the campaign dubbed 360XSS affected over 350 websites, including government portals, U.S. state government sites, American universities, major hotel chains, news outlets, car dealerships, and several Fortune 500 companies. This wasnt just a spam operation, the researcher said . It was an industrialscale abuse of trusted domains. All these websites have one thing in common A popular framework called Krpano thats used to embed 360 images and videos to facilitate interactive virtual tours and VR experiences. Zaytsev said he stumbled upon the campaign after coming across a pornographyrelated ad listed on Google Search but with a domain associated with Yale University virtualtour.quantuminstitute.yale.edu. A notable aspect of these URLs is an XML parameter thats designed to redirect the site visitor to a second URL that belongs to another legitimate website, which is then used to execute a Base64encoded payload via an XML document. The decoded payload, for its part, fetches the target URL i.e., the ad from yet another legitimate site. The XML parameter passed in the original URL served in the search results is part of a broader configuration setting named passQueryParameters thats used when embedding a Krpano panorama viewer into an HTML page. Its specifically designed to pass HTTP parameters from the URL to the viewer. The security issue here is that if the option is enabled, it opens the door to a scenario where an attacker could use a specially crafted URL to execute a malicious script in a victims web browser when the vulnerable site is visited. Indeed, a reflected XSS flaw arising as a result of this behavior was disclosed in Krpano in late 2020 CVE202024901 , CVSS score 6.1, indicating that the potential for abuse has been publicly known for over four years. While an update introduced in version 1.20.10 restricted passQueryParameters to an allowlist in an attempt to prevent such XSS attacks from taking place, Zaytsev found that explicitly adding the XML parameter to the allowlist reintroduced the XSS risk. Since version 1.20.10, Krpanos default installation was not vulnerable, the researcher told The Hacker News via email. However, configuring passQueryParameter in combination with the XML parameter allowed external XML configuration via the URL, leading to an XSS risk. The exploited versions Ive come across were primarily older ones, predating version 1.20.10. The campaign, per Zaytsev, has leveraged this weakness to hijack over 350 sites to serve sketchy ads related to pornography, diet supplements, online casinos, and fake news sites. Whats more, some of these pages have been weaponized to boost YouTube video views. The campaign is noteworthy, not least because it abuses the trust and credibility of legitimate domains to show up prominently in search results, a technique called search engine optimization SEO poisoning , which, in turn, is accomplished by abusing the XSS flaw. A reflected XSS is a fun vulnerability but on its own requires user interaction, and one of the biggest challenges is to make people click your reflected XSS link, Zaytsev said. So using search engines as a distribution platform for your XSS is a very creative and cool way to do it. Following responsible disclosure, the latest release of Krpano eliminates support for external configuration via the XML parameter, thereby mitigating the risk of XSS attacks even when the setting is used. Improved embedpano passQueryParameters security dataurls and external URLs are generally not allowed as parameter values anymore and URLs for the XML parameter are limited to be within the current folder structure, according to the release notes for version 1.22.4 released this week. Its currently not known who is behind the massive operation, although the abuse of an XSS flaw to serve just redirects, as opposed to carrying out more nefarious attacks like credential or cookie theft, raises the possibility of an ad firm with questionable practices thats serving these ads as a monetization strategy. Users of Krpano are advised to update their installations to the latest version and set the passQueryParameters setting to false. Affected website owners are recommended to find and remove infected pages via Google Search Console. Found this article interesting?

"Vulnerability Network Security A new malware campaign has been observed targeting edge devices from Cisco, ASUS, QNAP, and Synology to rope them into a botnet named PolarEdge since at least the end of 2023. French cybersecurity company Sekoia said it observed the unknown threat actors leveraging CVE202320118 CVSS score 6.5, a critical security flaw impacting Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers that could result in arbitrary command execution on susceptible devices. The vulnerability remains unpatched due to the routers reaching endoflife EoL status. As mitigations, Cisco recommended in early 2023 that the flaw be mitigated by disabling remote management and blocking access to ports 443 and 60443. In the attack registered against Sekoias honeypots, the vulnerability is said to have been used to deliver a previously undocumented implant, a TLS backdoor that incorporates the ability to listen for incoming client connections and execute commands. The backdoor is launched by means of a shell script called q thats retrieved via FTP and run following a successful exploitation of the vulnerability. It comes with capabilities to Cleanup log files Terminate suspicious processes Download a malicious payload named t.tar from 119.8.186.227 Execute a binary named cipher_log extracted from the archive Establish persistence by modifying a file named etcflashetccipher.sh to run the cipher_log binary repeatedly Execute cipher_log, the TLS backdoor Codenamed PolarEdge, the malware enters into an infinite loop, establishing a TLS session as well as spawning a child process to manage client requests and execute commands using exec_command. The binary informs the C2 server that it has successfully infected a new device, Sekoia researchers Jeremy Scion and Felix Aimé said. The malware transmits this information to the reporting server, enabling the attacker to determine which device was infected through the IP addressport pairing. Further analysis has uncovered similar PolarEdge payloads being used to target ASUS, QNAP, and Synology devices. All the artifacts were uploaded to VirusTotal by users located in Taiwan. The payloads are distributed via FTP using the IP address 119.8.186.227, which belongs to Huawei Cloud. In all, the botnet is estimated to have compromised 2,017 unique IP addresses around the world, with most of the infections detected in the United States, Taiwan, Russia, India, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina. The purpose of this botnet has not yet been determined, the researchers noted. An objective of PolarEdge could be to control compromised edge devices, transforming them into Operational Relay Boxes for launching offensive cyber attacks. The botnet exploits multiple vulnerabilities across different types of equipment, highlighting its ability to target various systems. The complexity of the payloads further underscores the sophistication of the operation, suggesting that it is being conducted by skilled operators. This indicates that PolarEdge is a wellcoordinated and substantial cyber threat. The disclosure comes as SecurityScorecard revealed that a massive botnet comprising over 130,000 infected devices is being weaponized to conduct largescale passwordspraying attacks against Microsoft 365 M365 accounts by exploiting noninteractive signins with Basic Authentication. Noninteractive signins are typically used for servicetoservice authentication and legacy protocols like POP, IMAP, and SMTP. They do not trigger multifactor authentication MFA in many configurations. Basic Authentication, on the other hand, allows credentials to be transmitted in plaintext format. The activity, likely the work of a Chineseaffiliated group owing to the use of infrastructure tied to CDS Global Cloud and UCLOUD HK, employs stolen credentials from infostealer logs across a wide range of M365 accounts to obtain unauthorized access and get hold of sensitive data. This technique bypasses modern login protections and evades MFA enforcement, creating a critical blind spot for security teams, the company said . Attackers leverage stolen credentials from infostealer logs to systematically target accounts at scale. These attacks are recorded in noninteractive signin logs, which are often overlooked by security teams. Attackers exploit this gap to conduct highvolume password spraying attempts undetected. This tactic has been observed across multiple M365 tenants globally, indicating a widespread and ongoing threat. Found this article interesting?

"Malware Cryptocurrency Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malicious Python library on the Python Package Index PyPI repository that facilitates unauthorized music downloads from music streaming service Deezer. The package in question is automslc, which has been downloaded over 104,000 times to date. First published in May 2019, it remains available on PyPI as of writing. Although automslc, which has been downloaded over 100,000 times, purports to offer music automation and metadata retrieval, it covertly bypasses Deezers access restrictions by embedding hardcoded credentials and communicating with an external commandandcontrol C2 server, Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko said in a report published today. Specifically, the package is designed to log into the French music streaming platform via usersupplied and hardcoded credentials, gather trackrelated metadata, and download full audio files in violation of Deezers API terms. The package also periodically communicates with a remote server located at 54.39.49.178031 to provide updates on the download status, thereby giving the threat actor centralized control over the coordinated music piracy operation. Put differently, automslc effectively turns the systems of the package users into an illicit network for facilitating bulk music downloads in an unauthorized manner. The IP address is associated with a domain named automusic.win, which is said to be used by the threat actor to oversee the distributed downloading operation. Deezers API terms forbid the local or offline storage of complete audio content, but by downloading and decrypting entire tracks, automslc bypasses this limitation, potentially placing users at risk of legal repercussions, Boychenko said. The disclosure comes as the software supply chain security company detailed a rogue npm package called tonwalletcreate that has been found stealing mnemonic phrases from unsuspecting users and developers in the TON ecosystem, while impersonating the legitimate tonton package. The package, first published to the npm registry in August 2024, has attracted 584 downloads to date. It remains available for download. The malicious functionality embedded into the library is capable of extracting the process.env.MNEMONIC environment variable, thereby giving threat actors complete access to a cryptocurrency wallet and potentially drain a victims digital assets. The information is transmitted to an attackercontrolled Telegram bot. This attack poses severe supply chain security risks, targeting developers and users integrating TON wallets into their applications, Socket said . Regular dependency audits and automated scanning tools should be employed to detect anomalous or malicious behaviors in thirdparty packages before they are integrated into production environments. Update The Python package automslc is no longer available for download from PyPI. Found this article interesting? Follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.

"The Hacker News Shadow AI is presenting new challenges for security leaders. While AI tools have already revolutionized how we work, theyve also created unprecedented security challenges that our traditional strategies or tools simply werent designed to handle. Ive spent the last decade working with organizations grappling with emerging tech risks, and I can tell you that this is different. In this post, well talk about why, and more importantly, what you can do about it. The Hidden Risks of AI Adoption Shadow AI The Wiz research team recently uncovered a publicly exposed DeepSeek production ClickHouse database , leaking chat history, API secrets, and other sensitive dataraising serious concerns for any organization using DeepSeeks models. Truth is that many teams rushed to try out DeepSeek given the hype around its truly advanced technologies. While the DeepSeek situation has been surrounded by FUD, drama, and misinformation, it has also set important precedents for privacy and security. In response to the incident Texas banned DeepSeek from government devices. AI malware impersonating DeepSeek has appeared in PyPi, posing additional security risks. Taiwan and Italy have restricted DeepSeek , citing data privacy concerns. Despite the controversy, DeepSeekR1 models are now available on AWS , raising further questions about adoption and security oversight. This is a clear reminder that without the right safeguards, AI tools can introduce serious risksand organizations will still use them because of the enhanced productivity value. Im a firm believer that cybersecurity should be a business enabler, not a roadblock. So how do we ensure our organizations can adopt these technologies without exposing sensitive data? Theres a way, and well get into it in the next sections! A perfect example of this challenge is Samsungs ChatGPT source code leak in early 2023 . An engineer inadvertently shared sensitive source code via ChatGPT leading to a source code leak and prompting the company to temporarily ban generative AI GenAI tools. The key takeaway here is that employees will adopt new technologies quickly, often before security teams can assess the riskseven in some of the most mature security organizations. The Hidden Cost of Innovation Why Shadow AI Is Different Heres why security leaders are facing a unique challengenew AI tools are popping up constantly , each designed to solve a specific business problem, and teams are adopting them faster than security can keep up. When marketing, HR, accounting, developers, and just about every other team across the organization is adopting new AI tools, traditional security reviews often introduce weekslong delays. How do you tell a team thats just doubled their productivity to stop using their favorite AI tool because it might be a security risk? In many cases, you dontby the time security steps in, AI adoption is already ingrained in workflows, making outright bans is a nonstarter and one that can put security leaders at odds with their counterparts. Another major challenge is that these tools are data sponges , capable of retaining and reproducing sensitive information in ways weve never encountered before. Have you ever asked ChatGPT what it thinks about you? Or asked it to summarize your character based on your interactions? This is an example of how it looks like remember that time when you asked for a specific recipe with no sugar for diabetics? The AI service retained that info from 6 months ago, and now knows about your health conditions. And since many of these AI tools operate as SaaS apps, they introduce an entirely new layer of riskdata flowing to thirdparty platforms for AI model training which falls outside traditional security controls. The reality is, most data security and SaaS security tools werent built to handle the dynamic, unpredictable nature of the AI apps were seeing. Creating a Culture of Secure Innovation Successful security teams recognize that securing AI adoption is not just a technical challenge it is also a cultural one. Instead of constantly reacting to unauthorized AI tools, they are building what I call an AIpositive security cultureone that enables innovation while maintaining security oversight. What does this look like in practice? It starts with proactive governance and Shadow AI detection to identify and control unsanctioned AI apps before they become security liabilities. Key elements include Crossfunctional AI governance committees that bring together security, IT, legal, and business teams to establish clear guidelines for safe AI adoption. This is especially critical for heavily regulated industries like finance, critical infrastructure, and healthcare. Automated discovery of Shadow AI usage to provide realtime visibility into unauthorized AI apps and data flows. Clear, enforceable policies that educate teams on which AI tools are approved, what data can be used, and how to integrate them securely. Gameplan How to Win in the Shadow AI Era Security teams need a structured approach that combines detection , policy enforcement , and continuous monitoring . Here is a practical roadmap to get started Immediate Steps Map your AI exposure. Use Shadow AI detection tools to uncover which AI apps employees are already using, rather than relying on selfreporting. Encourage transparency instead of penalizing usage. Identify your crown jewels. Determine which data must be strictly protected from external AI tools and establish clear policies and access controls to enforce this. Enforce AI security policies. Leverage CASBs, SaaS Security Posture Management SSPM, and AIaware DLP solutions to detect and block unauthorized AI data sharing. LongTerm Strategies Build an AI governance framework that evolves with the business to ensure policies remain relevant as AI tools advance. Invest in AIspecific companywide security training that explains why AI tools pose risks, not just a list of restricted apps. Deploy continuous monitoring to flag unauthorized AI services as they emerge. How Reco Helps Organizations Secure Shadow AI Security teams cant afford to chase down every AI tool that enters the enterprise. Furthermore, asking people to report all the AI tools they use is not a scalable strategy. And while traditional solutions such as CASBs and browser plugins can offer insight into some shadow services, they fail to recognize AI assistants or copilots that share a domain with your approved tools. So how can you take back control of the AI tools being used in your enterprise? Reco can help. Reco is a dynamic SaaS security solution that keeps pace with the SaaS rate of change.

"The Hacker News Machine Learning Threat Detection Organizations today face relentless cyber attacks, with highprofile breaches hitting the headlines almost daily. Reflecting on a long journey in the security field, its clear this isnt just a human problemits a math problem. There are simply too many threats and security tasks for any SOC to manually handle in a reasonable timeframe. Yet, there is a solution. Many refer to it as SOC 3.0an AIaugmented environment that finally lets analysts do more with less and shifts security operations from a reactive posture to a proactive force. The transformative power of SOC 3.0 will be detailed later in this article, showcasing how artificial intelligence can dramatically reduce workload and risk, delivering worldclass security operations that every CISO dreams of. However, to appreciate this leap forward, its important to understand how the SOC evolved over time and why the steps leading up to 3.0 set the stage for a new era of security operations. A brief history of the SOC For decades, the Security Operations Center SOC has been the front line for defending organizations against cyber threats. As threats become faster and more sophisticated, the SOC must evolve. Ive personally witnessed three distinct phases of SOC evolution. I like to refer to them as SOC 1.0 Traditional SOC, SOC 2.0 the current, partly automated SOC, and SOC 3.0 the AIpowered, modern SOC. In this article I provide an overview of each phase, focusing on four core functions Alert triage and remediation Detection correlation Threat investigation Data processing SOC 1.0 The traditional, manual SOC Lets take a look at how the earliest SOCs handled alert triage and remediation, detection correlation, threat investigation and data processing. Handling noisy alerts with manual triage remediation In the early days, we spent an inordinate amount of time on simple triage . Security engineers would build or configure alerts, and the SOC team would then struggle under a neverending flood of noise. False positives abounded. For example, if an alert fired every time a test server connected to a nonproduction domain, the SOC quickly realized it was harmless noise. Wed exclude lowseverity or known test infrastructure from logging or alerting. This back and forthTune these alerts! or Exclude this server!became the norm. SOC resources were invested more in managing alert fatigue than in addressing real security problems. Remediation , too, was entirely manual. Most organizations had a Standard Operating Procedure SOP stored in a wiki or SharePoint. After an alert was deemed valid, an analyst would walk through the SOP Identify the affected system Isolate the host Reset credentials Collect logs for forensics, and so on. These SOPs lived primarily in static documents, requiring manual intervention at every step. The main tools in this process were the SIEM often a platform like QRadar, ArcSight, or Splunk combined with collaboration platforms like SharePoint for knowledge documentation. Early SIEM and correlation challenges During the SOC 1.0 phase, detection and correlation mostly meant manually written queries and rules. SIEMs required advanced expertise to build correlation searches. SOC engineers or SIEM specialists wrote complex query logic to connect the dots between logs, events, and known Indicators of Compromise IOCs. A single missed OR or an incorrect join in a search query could lead to countless false negatives or false positives. The complexity was so high that only a small subset of expert individuals in the organization could maintain these rule sets effectively, leading to bottlenecks and slow response times. OnlyExperts for L2 L3 threat investigation Threat investigations required highly skilled and expensive security analysts. Because everything was manual, each suspicious event demanded that a senior analyst perform log deep dives, run queries, and piece together the story from multiple data sources. There was no real scalability each team could only handle a certain volume of alerts. Junior analysts were often stuck at Level 1 triage, escalating most incidents to more senior staff due to a lack of efficient tools and processes. Manual pipelines for data processing With big data came big problems such as manual data ingestion and parsing. Each log source needed its own integration, with specific parsing rules and indexing configuration. If you changed vendors or added new solutions, youd spend months or even multiple quarters on integration. For SIEMs like QRadar, administrators had to configure new database tables, data fields, and indexing rules for each new log type. This was slow, brittle, and prone to human error. Finally, many organizations used separate pipelines for shipping logs to different destinations. This was also manually configured and likely to break whenever sources changed. In short, SOC 1.0 was marked by high costs, heavy manual effort, and a focus on keeping the lights on rather than on true security innovation. SOC 2.0 The current, partly automated SOC The challenges of SOC 1.0 spurred innovation. The industry responded with platforms and approaches that automated to some degree key workflows. Enriched alerts automated playbooks With the advent of SOAR Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response, alerts in the SIEM could be enriched automatically . An IP address in an alert, for example, could be checked against threat intelligence feeds and geolocation services. A host name could be correlated with an asset inventory or vulnerability management database. This additional context empowered analysts to decide faster whether an alert is credible. Automated SOPs was another big improvement. SOAR tools allowed analysts to codify some of their repetitive tasks and run playbooks automatically. Instead of referencing a wiki page step by step, the SOC could rely on automated scripts to perform parts of the remediation, like isolating a host or blocking an IP. However, the decisionmaking piece between enrichment and automated action remained highly manual. Analysts might have better context, but they still had to think through what to do next. And to make matters worse, the SOAR tools themselves e.g., Torq, Tines, BlinkOps, Cortex XSOAR, Swimlane needed extensive setup and maintenance. Expert security engineers had to create and constantly update playbooks. If a single external API changed, entire workflows could fail. Simply replacing your endpoint vendor would trigger weeks of catch up in a SOAR platform. The overhead of building and maintaining these automations is not exactly trivial. Upgraded SIEM Outofthebox detection XDR In SOC 2.0, detection and correlation saw key advances in outofthebox content. Modern SIEM platforms and XDR Extended Detection and Response solutions offer libraries of prebuilt detection rules tailored to common threats, saving time for SOC analysts who previously had to write everything from scratch. Tools like Exabeam, Securonix, Gurucul and Hunters aim to correlate data from multiple sources endpoints, cloud workloads, network traffic, identity providers more seamlessly. Vendors like Anvilogic or Panther Labs provide libraries of comprehensive rule sets for various sources, significantly reducing the complexity of writing queries. Incremental improvements in threat investigation Despite XDR advances, the actual threat investigation workflow remains very similar to SOC 1.0. Tools are better integrated and more data is available at a glance, but the analysis process still relies on manual correlation and the expertise of seasoned analysts. While XDR can surface suspicious activity more efficiently, it doesnt inherently automate the deeper forensic or threathunting tasks. Senior analysts remain crucial to interpret nuanced signals and tie multiple threat artifacts together. Streamlined integrations data cost control Data processing in SOC 2.0 has also improved with more Integrations and better control over multiple data pipelines. For example, SIEMs like Microsoft Sentinel offer automatic parsing and builtin schemas for popular data sources. This accelerates deployment and shortens timetovalue. Solutions like CRIBL allow organizations to define data pipelines once and route logs to the right destinations in the right format with the right enrichments. For example, a single data source might be enriched with threat intel tags and then sent to both a SIEM for security analysis and a data lake for longterm storage. These improvements certainly help reduce the burden on the SOC, but maintaining these integrations and pipelines can still be complex. Moreover, the cost of storing and querying massive volumes of data in a cloudbased SIEM or XDR platform remains a major budget item. In sum, SOC 2.0 delivered significant progress in automated enrichment and remediation playbooks. But the heavy liftingcritical thinking, contextual decisionmaking, and sophisticated threat analysisremains manual and burdensome. SOC teams still scramble to keep up with new threats, new data sources, and the overhead of maintaining automation frameworks. SOC 3.0 The AIpowered, modern SOC Enter SOC 3.0 , where artificial intelligence and distributed data lakes promise a quantum leap in operational efficiency and threat detection. AIdriven triage remediation Thanks to breakthroughs in AI, the SOC can now automate much of the triage and investigation process with AI. Machine learning modelstrained on vast datasets of normal and malicious behaviorcan automatically classify and prioritize alerts with minimal human intervention. AI models are also packed with security knowledge which helps augment human analysts capability to efficiently research and apply new information to their practices. Instead of building rigid playbooks, AI dynamically generates response options . Analysts can review, modify, and execute these actions with a single click. Once a SOC team gains trust in AIaugmented responses they can let the system remediate automatically, further reducing response times. This doesnt eliminate human oversight, with humansintheloop reviewing the AIs triage reasoning and response recommendations , but it does drastically reduce the manual, repetitive tasks that bog down SOC analysts. Junior analysts can focus on highlevel validation and signoff, while AI handles the heavy lifting. Adaptive detection correlation The SIEM and XDR layer in SOC 3.0 is far more automated with AIML models, rather than human experts, creating and maintaining correlation rules. The system continuously learns from realworld data, adjusting rules to reduce false positives and detect novel attack patterns. Ongoing threat intelligence feeds, behavioral analysis, and context from across the entire environment come together in near realtime. This intelligence is automatically integrated, so the SOC can adapt instantly to new threats without waiting for manual rule updates. Automated deepdive threat investigations Arguably the most transformative change is in how AI enables nearinstantaneous investigations with no need to codify. Instead of writing a detailed manual or script for investigating each type of threat, AI engines process and query large volumes of data and produce contextually rich investigation paths. Deep analysis at high speed is all in a days work for AI as it can correlate thousands of events and logs from distributed data sources within minutes and often within seconds, surfacing the most relevant insights to the analyst. Finally, SOC 3.0 empowers junior analysts as even a Level 1 or 2 analyst can use these AIdriven investigations to handle incidents that would traditionally require a senior staff member. Vendors in this space include startups offering AIbased security copilots and automated SOC platforms that drastically shorten investigation time and MTTR . Distributed data lakes optimized spend While the volume of data required to fuel AIdriven security grows, SOC 3.0 relies on a more intelligent approach to data storage and querying Distributed data lake AIbased tools dont necessarily rely on a single, monolithic data store. Instead, they can query data where it residesbe it a legacy SIEM, a vendors freetier storage, or an S3 bucket you own. This approach is critical for cost optimization. For instance, some EDRXDR vendors like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne offer free storage for 1st party data, so its economical to keep that data in their native environment. Meanwhile, other logs can be stored in cheaper cloud storage solutions. Flexible, ondemand queries SOC 3.0 enables organizations to bring the query to the data rather than forcing all logs into a single expensive repository. This means you can leverage a costeffective S3 bucket for large volumes of data, while still being able to rapidly query and enrich it in near realtime. Data residency and performance concerns are also addressed by distributing the data in the most logical locationcloser to the source, in compliance with local regulations, or in whichever geography is best for costperformance tradeoffs. Avoiding vendor lockin In SOC 3.0, youre not locked into a single platforms storage model. If you cant afford to store or analyze everything in a vendors SIEM, you can still choose to keep it in your own environment at a fraction of the costyet still query it on demand when needed. Conclusion From a CISOs vantage point, SOC 3.0 isnt just a buzzword. Its the natural next step in modern cybersecurity, enabling teams to handle more threats at lower cost, with better accuracy and speed. While AI wont replace the need for human expertise, it will fundamentally shift the SOCs operating model allowing security professionals to do more with less , focus on strategic initiatives, and maintain a stronger security posture against todays rapidly evolving threat landscape.

"Network Security Threat Intelligence The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine CERTUA on Tuesday warned of renewed activity from an organized criminal group it tracks as UAC0173 that involves infecting computers with a remote access trojan named DCRat aka DarkCrystal RAT. The Ukrainian cybersecurity authority said it observed the latest attack wave starting in midJanuary 2025. The activity is designed to target the Notary of Ukraine. The infection chain leverages phishing emails that claim to be sent on behalf of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, urging recipients to download an executable, which, when launched, leads to the deployment of the DCRat malware. The binary is hosted in Cloudflares R2 cloud storage service. Having thus provided primary access to the notarys automated workplace, the attackers take measures to install additional tools, in particular, RDPWRAPPER, which implements the functionality of parallel RDP sessions, which, in combination with the use of the BORE utility, allows you to establish RDP connections from the Internet directly to the computer, CERTUA said . The attacks are also characterized by the use of other tools and malware families like FIDDLER for intercepting authentication data entered in the web interface of state registers, NMAP for network scanning, and XWorm for stealing sensitive data, such as credentials and clipboard content. Furthermore, the compromised systems are used as a conduit to draft and send malicious emails using the SENDMAIL console utility in order to further propagate the attacks. The development comes days after CERTUA attributed a subcluster within the Sandworm hacking group aka APT44, Seashell Blizzard, and UAC0002 to the exploitation of a nowpatched security flaw in Microsoft Windows CVE202438213 , CVSS score 6.5 in the second half of 2024 via boobytrapped documents. The attack chains have been found to execute PowerShell commands responsible for displaying a decoy file, while simultaneously launching additional payloads in the background, including SECONDBEST aka EMPIREPAST, SPARK, and a Golang loader named CROOKBAG. The activity, attributed to UAC0212, targeted supplier companies from Serbia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine between July 2024 and February 2025, with some of them recorded against more than two dozen Ukrainian enterprises specializing in development of automated process control systems ACST, electrical works, and freight transportation. Some of these attacks have been documented by StrikeReady Labs and Microsoft, the latter of which is tracking the threat group under the moniker BadPilot . Found this article interesting?

"Malware Network Security The threat actor known as Space Pirates has been linked to a malicious campaign targeting Russian information technology IT organizations with a previously undocumented malware called LuckyStrike Agent. The activity was detected in November 2024 by Solar, the cybersecurity arm of Russian stateowned telecom company Rostelecom. Its tracking the activity under the name Erudite Mogwai. The attacks are also characterized by the use of other tools like Deed RAT , also called ShadowPad Light, and a customized version of proxy utility named Stowaway , which has been previously used by other Chinalinked hacking groups. Erudite Mogwai is one of the active APT groups specializing in the theft of confidential information and espionage, Solar researchers said . Since at least 2017, the group has been attacking government agencies, IT departments of various organizations, as well as enterprises related to hightech industries such as aerospace and electric power. The threat actor was first publicly documented by Positive Technologies in 2022, detailing its exclusive use of the Deed RAT malware. The group is believed to share tactical overlaps with another hacking group called Webworm. Its known to target organizations in Russia, Georgia, and Mongolia. In one of the attacks targeting a government sector customer, Solar said it discovered the attacker deploying various tools to facilitate reconnaissance, while also dropping LuckyStrike Agent, a multifunctional .NET backdoor that uses Microsoft OneDrive for commandandcontrol C2. The attackers gained access to the infrastructure by compromising a publicly accessible web service no later than March 2023, and then began looking for lowhanging fruit in the infrastructure, Solar said. Over the course of 19 months, the attackers slowly spread across the customers systems until they reached the network segments connected to monitoring in November 2024. Also noteworthy is the use of a modified version of Stowaway to retain only its proxy functionality, alongside using LZ4 as a compression algorithm, incorporating XXTEA as an encryption algorithm, and adding support for the QUIC transport protocol. Erudite Mogwai began their journey in modifying this utility by cutting down the functionality they didnt need, Solar said. They continued with minor edits, such as renaming functions and changing the sizes of structures probably to knock down existing detection signatures. At the moment, the version of Stowaway used by this group can be called a fullfledged fork. Found this article interesting? Follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn to read more exclusive content we post.

"Malware Cryptocurrency Freelance software developers are the target of an ongoing campaign that leverages job interviewthemed lures to deliver crossplatform malware families known as BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret. The activity, linked to North Korea, has been codenamed DeceptiveDevelopment, which overlaps with clusters tracked under the names Contagious Interview aka CLSTA0240 , DEVPOPPER, Famous Chollima, PurpleBravo, and Tenacious Pungsan. The campaign has been ongoing since at least late 2023. DeceptiveDevelopment targets freelance software developers through spearphishing on jobhunting and freelancing sites, aiming to steal cryptocurrency wallets and login information from browsers and password managers, cybersecurity company ESET said in a report shared with The Hacker News. In November 2024, ESET confirmed to The Hacker News the overlaps between DeceptiveDevelopment and Contagious Interview, classifying it as a new Lazarus Group activity that operates with an aim to conduct cryptocurrency theft . The attack chains are characterized by the use of fake recruiter profiles on social media to reach out to prospective targets and share with them trojanized codebases hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket that deploy backdoors under the pretext of a job interview process. Subsequent iterations of the campaign have branched out to other jobhunting platforms like Upwork, Freelancer.com, We Work Remotely, Moonlight, and Crypto Jobs List. As previously highlighted , these hiring challenges typically entail fixing bugs or adding new features to the cryptorelated project. Other than coding tests, the bogus projects masquerade as cryptocurrency initiatives, games with blockchain functionality, and gambling apps with cryptocurrency features. More often than not, the malicious code is embedded within a benign component in the form of a single line. Additionally, they are instructed to build and execute the project in order to test it, which is where the initial compromise happens, security researcher Matěj Havránek said. The repositories used are usually private, so the vicm is first asked to provide their account ID or email address to be granted access to them, most likely to conceal the malicious activity from researchers. A second method used for achieving initial compromise revolves around tricking their victims into installing a malwarelaced video conferencing platform like MiroTalk or FreeConference . While both BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret come with informationstealing capabilities, the former serves as a downloader for the latter. BeaverTail also comes in two flavors A JavaScript variant that can be placed within the trojanized projects and a native version built using the Qt platform thats disguised as conferencing software. InvisibleFerret is a modular Python malware that retrieves and executes three additional components pay , which collects information and acts as a backdoor thats capable of accepting remote commands from an attackercontrolled server to log keystrokes, capture clipboard content, run shell commands, exfiltrate files and data from mounted drives, as well as install the AnyDesk and browser module, and gather information from browser extensions and password managers bow , which is responsible for stealing login data, autofill data, and payment information stored in Chromiumbased browsers like Chrome, Brave, Opera, Yandex, and Edge adc , which functions as a persistence mechanism by installing the AnyDesk remote desktop software ESET said the primary targets of the campaign are software developers working in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance projects across the world, with significant concentrations reported in Finland, India, Italy, Pakistan, Spain, South Africa, Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. The attackers dont distinguish based on geographical location and aim to compromise as many victims as possible to increase the likelihood of successfully extracting funds and information. This is also evidenced in the apparent poor coding practices adopted by the operators, ranging from a failure to remove development notes to local IP addresses used for development and testing, indicating that the intrusion set is not concerned about stealth. Its worth noting that the use of job interview decoys is a classic strategy adopted by various North Korean hacking groups, the most prominent of which is a longrunning campaign dubbed Operation Dream Job . Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the threat actors are also involved in the fraudulent IT worker scheme , in which North Korean nationals apply for overseas jobs under false identities in order to draw regular salaries as a way to fund the regimes priorities. The overlaps include mutual follows between GitHub accounts controlled by the attackers and those containing fake CVs used by North Korean IT workers. Some of the GitHub pages in question have since been taken down. The DeceptiveDevelopment cluster is an addition to an already large collection of moneymaking schemes employed by North Koreaaligned actors and conforms to an ongoing trend of shifting focus from traditional money to cryptocurrencies, ESET said. During our research, we observed it go from primitive tools and techniques to more advanced and capable malware, as well as more polished techniques to lure in victims and deploy the malware.

"Financial Crime Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit on Friday revealed that a sophisticated attack led to the theft of over 1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency from one of its Ethereum cold offline wallets, making it the largest ever single crypto heist in history. The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet executed a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic, Bybit said in a post on X. As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address. In a separate statement posted on the social media platform, Bybits CEO Ben Zhou emphasized that all other cold wallets are secure. The company further said it has reported the case to the appropriate authorities. While there is no official confirmation from Bybit yet, Elliptic and Arkham Intelligence confirmed that the digital theft is the work of the infamous Lazarus Group. The incident makes it the biggestever cryptocurrency heist reported to date, dwarfing that of Ronin Network 624 million, Poly Network 611 million, and BNB Bridge 586 million. Independent researcher ZachXBT said they connected the Bybit hack onchain to the Phemex hack , the latter of which took place late last month. The North Koreabased threat actor is one of the most prolific hacking groups, orchestrating dozens of cryptocurrency heists to generate illicit revenue for the sanctionshit nation. Last year, Google described North Korea as arguably the worlds leading cyber criminal enterprise. In 2024, its estimated to have stolen 1.34 billion across 47 cryptocurrency hacks, accounting for 61 of all illgotten crypto during the time period, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis. Cryptocurrency heists are on the rise due to the lucrative nature of their rewards, the challenges associated with attribution to malicious actors, and the opportunities presented by nascent familiarity with cryptocurrency and Web3 technologies among many organizations, Googleowned Mandiant said last month. Update In a standalone update, Bybit said it detected unauthorized activity within one of our Ethereum ETH Cold Wallets during a planned routine transfer process on , at around 1230 p.m. UTC. The transfer was part of a scheduled move of ETH from our ETH Multisig Cold Wallet to our Hot Wallet, it said in a statement. Unfortunately, the transaction was manipulated by a sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH Cold Wallet. As a result, over 400,000 ETH and stETH worth more than 1.5 billion were transferred to an unidentified address. TRM Labs has also attributed the hack with high confidence to the Lazarus Group, based on substantial overlaps observed between addresses controlled by the Bybit hackers and those linked to prior North Korean thefts such as Phemex, BingX, and Poloniex . The recent incident with Bybit marks a new phase in attack methods, featuring advanced techniques for manipulating user interfaces, Check Point Research noted . Instead of just exploiting protocol mechanics, the attackers employed advanced social engineering through manipulated interfaces, allowing them to compromise a significant institutional multisig setup. The cybersecurity company also pointed out that the attack highlights a scenario where threat actors are manipulating legitimate transactions through the Gnosis Safe Protocols execTransaction function, stating multisig cold wallets are not secure if signers can be deceived or compromised, emphasizing the growing sophistication of supply chain and user interface manipulation attacks. In a detailed analysis published over the weekend, Elliptic noted that the Lazarus Groups laundering process follows a characteristic pattern, which involves exchanging stolen tokens for a native blockchain asset like Ether to avoid attempts to freeze the digital assets. This is exactly what happened in the minutes following the Bybit theft, with hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen tokens such as stETH and cmETH exchanged for Ether, the company stated , adding the funds were layered to cover up the transaction trail by routing them to 50 different wallets within two hours of the theft, and then shifting them through crypto exchanges like eXch to convert them into bitcoin. North Koreas Lazarus Group is the most sophisticated and wellresourced launderer of cryptoassets in existence, continually adapting its techniques to evade identification and seizure of stolen assets, Elliptic said. Elliptic further called out cryptocurrency exchange eXch for allowing North Korean threat actors to launder the illgotten proceeds by allowing its users to swap crypto assets anonymously. Its assessed that stolen cryptocurrency from Bybit worth over 75 million have been exchanged using eXch, converting the digital funds into bitcoin. However, eXch has denied laundering funds stolen from Bybit, stating it is NOT laundering money for LazarusDPRK and that insignificant part of funds that was processed by us from the ByBit hack in an isolated case will be donated to various opensource initiatives dedicated to privacy and security both inside and outside crypto space. They certainly are laundering the funds stolen by DPRK from Bybit its visible on the blockchain, Dr. Tom Robinson, cofounder and chief scientist at Elliptic, told The Hacker News. Over 75 million of the stolen funds have been laundered through eXch so far. They are trying to conceal it and the total figure may be more than this. And this isnt the first time cryptoassets from multiple previous DPRKattributed hacks have been sent through eXch.

"Disinformation Artificial Intelligence OpenAI on Friday revealed that it banned a set of accounts that used its ChatGPT tool to develop a suspected artificial intelligence AIpowered surveillance tool. The social media listening tool is said to likely originate from China and is powered by one of Metas Llama models , with the accounts in question using the AI companys models to generate detailed descriptions and analyze documents for an apparatus capable of collecting realtime data and reports about antiChina protests in the West and sharing the insights with Chinese authorities. The campaign has been codenamed Peer Review owing to the networks behavior in promoting and reviewing surveillance tooling, researchers Ben Nimmo, Albert Zhang, Matthew Richard, and Nathaniel Hartley noted, adding the tool is designed to ingest and analyze posts and comments from platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, and Reddit. In one instance flagged by the company, the actors used ChatGPT to debug and modify source code thats believed to run the monitoring software, referred to as Qianyue Overseas Public Opinion AI Assistant. Besides using its model as a research tool to surface publicly available information about think tanks in the United States, and government officials and politicians in countries like Australia, Cambodia and the United States, the cluster has also been found to leverage ChatGPT access to read, translate and analyze screenshots of Englishlanguage documents. Some of the images were announcements of Uyghur rights protests in various Western cities, and were likely copied from social media. Its currently not known if these images were authentic. OpenAI also said it disrupted several other clusters that were found abusing ChatGPT for various malicious activities Deceptive Employment Scheme A network from North Korea linked to the fraudulent IT worker scheme that was involved in the creation of personal documentation for fictitious job applicants, such as resumés, online job profiles and cover letters, as well as come up convincing responses to explain unusual behaviors like avoiding video calls, accessing corporate systems from unauthorized countries or working irregular hours. Some of the bogus job applications were then shared on LinkedIn. Sponsored Discontent A network likely of Chinese origin that was involved in the creation of social media content in English and longform articles in Spanish that were critical of the United States, and subsequently published by Latin American news websites in Peru, Mexico, and Ecuador. Some of the activity overlaps with a known activity cluster dubbed Spamouflage . Romancebaiting Scam A network of accounts that was involved in the translation and generation of comments in Japanese, Chinese, and English for posting on social media platforms including Facebook, X and Instagram in connection with suspected Cambodiaorigin romance and investment scams . Iranian Influence Nexus A network of five accounts that was involved in the generation of X posts and articles that were proPalestinian, proHamas, and proIran, and antiIsrael and antiU.S., and shared on websites associated with an Iranian influence operations tracked as the International Union of Virtual Media IUVM and Storm2035 . One among the banned accounts was used to create content for both the operations, indicative of a previously unreported relationship. Kimsuky and BlueNoroff A network of accounts operated by North Korean threat actors that was involved in gathering information related to cyber intrusion tools and cryptocurrencyrelated topics , and debugging code for Remote Desktop Protocol RDP bruteforce attacks. Youth Initiative Covert Influence Operation A network of accounts that was involved in the creation of Englishlanguage articles for a website named Empowering Ghana and social media comments targeting the Ghana presidential election. Task Scam A network of accounts likely originating from Cambodia that was involved in the translation of comments between Urdu and English as part of a scam that lures unsuspecting people into jobs performing simple tasks e.g., liking videos or writing reviews in exchange for earning a nonexistent commission, accessing which requires victims to part with their own money. The development comes as AI tools are being increasingly used by bad actors to facilitate cyberenabled disinformation campaigns and other malicious operations. Last month, Google Threat Intelligence Group GTIG revealed that over 57 distinct threat actors with ties to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia used its Gemini AI chatbot to improve multiple phases of the attack cycle and conduct research into topical events, or perform content creation, translation, and localization. Another report from Check First, published in collaboration with Reset.tech and AI Forensics, found that the Russialinked Social Design Agency SDA behind the Doppelganger covert influence campaign posted more than 8,000 political advertisements on Facebook that are aligned with Kremlin interests and seek to amplify divisive narratives. Tailored to ongoing political events, their ads employed inflammatory narratives and visually compelling content to maximize reach and impact, the Finnish company said , adding the findings highlight significant gaps in Metas attempts to moderate paidfor content. The unique insights that AI companies can glean from threat actors are particularly valuable if they are shared with upstream providers, such as hosting and software developers, downstream distribution platforms, such as social media companies, and opensource researchers, OpenAI said. Equally, the insights that upstream and downstream providers and researchers have into threat actors open up new avenues of detection and enforcement for AI companies. Found this article interesting?

"Cybercrime Cryptocurrency The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI formally linked the recordbreaking 1.5 billion Bybit hack to North Korean threat actors, as the companys CEO Ben Zhou declared a war against Lazarus. The agency said the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea North Korea was responsible for the theft of the virtual assets from the cryptocurrency exchange, attributing it to a specific cluster it tracks as TraderTraitor, which is also referred to as Jade Sleet, Slow Pisces, and UNC4899. TraderTraitor actors are proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains, the FBI said . It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency. Its worth noting that the TraderTraitor cluster was previously implicated by Japanese and U.S. authorities in the theft of cryptocurrency worth 308 million from cryptocurrency company DMM Bitcoin in May 2024. The threat actor is known for targeting companies in the Web3 sector, often tricking victims into downloading malwarelaced cryptocurrency apps to facilitate theft. Alternately, it has also been found to orchestrate jobthemed social engineering campaigns that lead to the deployment of malicious npm packages. ByBit, in the meanwhile, has launched a bounty program to help recover the stolen funds, while calling out eXch for refusing to cooperate in the probe and help freeze the assets. The stolen funds have been transferred to untraceable or freezeable destinations, such as exchanges, mixers, or bridges, or converted into stablecoins that can be frozen, it said. We require cooperation from all involved parties to either freeze the funds or provide updates on their movement so we can continue tracing. The Dubaibased company has also shared the conclusions of two investigations conducted by Sygnia and Verichains, linking the hack to the Lazarus Group. The forensics investigation of the three signers hosts suggests the root cause of the attack is malicious code originating from SafeWallets infrastructure, Sygnia said. Verichains noted that the benign JavaScript file of app.safe.global appears to have been replaced with malicious code on , at 152925 UTC, specifically targeting Ethereum Multisig Cold Wallet of Bybit, and that the attack was designed to activate during the next Bybit transaction, which occurred on , at 141335 UTC. Its suspected that the AWS S3 or CloudFront accountAPI Key of Safe.Global was likely leaked or compromised, thereby paving the way for a supply chain attack. In a separate statement, multisig wallet platform SafeWallet said the attack was carried out by compromising one of its developers machines which affected an account operated by Bybit. The company further noted that it implemented added security measures to mitigate the attack vector. The attack was achieved through a compromised machine of a SafeWallet developer resulting in the proposal of a disguised malicious transaction, it said . Lazarus is a statesponsored North Korean hacker group that is well known for sophisticated social engineering attacks on developer credentials, sometimes combined with zeroday exploits. Its currently not clear how the developers system was breached, although a new analysis from Silent Push has uncovered that the Lazarus Group registered the domain bybitassessment.com at 222157 on , a few hours before the cryptocurrency theft took place. WHOIS records show that the domain was registered using the email address trevorgreer9312gmail.com, which has been previously identified as a persona used by the Lazarus Group in connection with another campaign dubbed Contagious Interview. It appears the Bybit heist was conducted by the DPRK threat actor group known as TraderTraitor, also known as Jade Sleet and Slow Pisces whereas the crypto interview scam is being led by a DPRK threat actor group known as Contagious Interview , also known as Famous Chollima, the company said . Victims are typically approached via LinkedIn, where they are socially engineered into participating in fake job interviews. These interviews serve as an entry point for targeted malware deployment, credential harvesting, and further compromise of financial and corporate assets. North Korealinked actors are estimated to have stolen over 6 billion in crypto assets since 2017. The 1.5 billion stolen last week surpasses the 1.34 billion the threat actors stole from 47 cryptocurrency heists in all of 2024. Found this article interesting?

"Ransomware Cyber Threat More than a years worth of internal chat logs from a ransomware gang known as Black Basta have been published online in a leak that provides unprecedented visibility into their tactics and internal conflicts among its members. The Russianlanguage chats on the Matrix messaging platform between , and , were initially leaked on , by an individual who goes by the handle ExploitWhispers , who claimed that they released the data because the group was targeting Russian banks. The identity of the leaker remains a mystery. Black Basta first came under the spotlight in April 2022, using the nowlargelydefunct QakBot aka QBot as a delivery vehicle. According to an advisory published by the U.S. government in May 2024, the double extortion crew is estimated to have targeted more than 500 private industry and critical infrastructure entities in North America, Europe, and Australia. Per Elliptic and Corvus Insurance, the prolific ransomware group is estimated to have netted at least 107 million in Bitcoin ransom payments from more than 90 victims by the end of 2023. Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT said the financially motivated threat actor, also tracked as Vengeful Mantis, has been mostly inactive since the start of the year due to internal strife, with some of its operators scamming victims by collecting ransom payments without providing a working decryptor. Whats more, key members of the Russialinked cybercrime syndicate are said to have jumped ship to the CACTUS aka Nurturing Mantis and Akira ransomware operations. The internal conflict was driven by Tramp LARVA18, a known threat actor who operates a spamming network responsible for distributing QBot, PRODAFT said in a post on X. As a key figure within BLACKBASTA, his actions played a major role in the groups instability. Some of the salient aspects of the leak, which contains nearly 200,000 messages, are listed below Lapa is one of the main administrators of Black Basta and involved in administrative tasks Cortes is associated with the QakBot group, which has sought to distance itself in the wake of Black Bastas attacks against Russian banks YY is another administrator of Black Basta who is involved in support tasks Trump is one of the aliases for the groups main boss Oleg Nefedov, who goes by the names GG and AA Trump and another individual, Bio, worked together in the nowdismantled Conti ransomware scheme One of the Black Basta affiliates is believed to be a minor aged 17 years Black Basta has begun to actively incorporate social engineering into their attacks following the success of Scattered Spider According to Qualys, the Black Basta group leverages known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insufficient security controls to obtain initial access to target networks. The discussions show that SMB misconfigurations, exposed RDP servers, and weak authentication mechanisms are routinely exploited, often relying on default VPN credentials or bruteforcing stolen credentials. Top 20 CVEs Actively Exploited by Black Basta Another key attack vector entails the deployment of malware droppers to deliver the malicious payloads. In a further attempt to evade detection, the ecrime group has been found to use legitimate filesharing platforms like transfer.sh, temp.sh, and send.vis.ee for hosting the payloads. Ransomware groups are no longer taking their time once they breach an organizations network, Saeed Abbasi, manager of product at Qualys Threat Research Unit TRU, said . Recently leaked data from Black Basta shows theyre moving from initial access to networkwide compromise within hours sometimes even minutes. The disclosure comes as Check Points Cyberint Research Team revealed that the Cl0p ransomware group has resumed targeting organizations, listing organizations that were breached on its data leak site following the exploitation of a recently disclosed security flaw CVE202450623 impacting the Cleo managed file transfer software. Cl0p is contacting these companies directly, providing secure chat links for negotiations and email addresses for victims to initiate contact, the company said in an update posted last week. The group warned that if the companies continue to ignore them, their full names will be disclosed within 48 hours. The development also follows an advisory released by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA about a wave of data exfiltration and ransomware attacks orchestrated by the Ghost actors targeting organizations across more than 70 countries, including those in China. The group has been observed rotating its ransomware executable payloads, switching file extensions for encrypted files, and modifying ransom note text, leading the group called by other names such as Cring, Crypt3r, Phantom, Strike, Hello, Wickrme, HsHarada, and Rapture. Beginning early 2021, Ghost actors began attacking victims whose internet facing services ran outdated versions of software and firmware, the agency said . Ghost actors, located in China, conduct these widespread attacks for financial gain. Affected victims include critical infrastructure, schools and universities, healthcare, government networks, religious institutions, technology and manufacturing companies, and numerous small and mediumsized businesses. Ghost is known to use publicly available code to exploit internetfacing systems by employing various vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion CVE20093960 , CVE20102861 , Fortinet FortiOS appliances CVE201813379 , and Microsoft Exchange Server CVE202134473 , CVE202134523 , and CVE202131207 , aka ProxyShell. A successful exploitation is followed by the deployment of a web shell, which is then utilized to download and execute the Cobalt Strike framework. The threat actors have also been observed using a wide range of tools like Mimikatz and BadPotato for credential harvesting and privilege escalation, respectively. Ghost actors used elevated access and Windows Management Instrumentation CommandLine WMIC to run PowerShell commands on additional systems on the victim network often for the purpose of initiating additional Cobalt Strike Beacon infections, CISA said. In cases where lateral movement attempts are unsuccessful, Ghost actors have been observed abandoning an attack on a victim. Update Cybersecurity company VulnCheck revealed that 62 unique CVEs were mentioned in the Black Basta chat logs, of which 53 of them 85.5 are known to be exploited in the wild. Black Basta shows a clear preference for targets with known weaknesses, focusing on vulnerabilities that already have available exploits, VulnChecks Patrick Garrity said . The group seems to favor widely adopted enterprise technologies, including products like Citrix NetScaler, Confluence Atlassian, Fortinet, Cisco, Palo Alto, CheckPoint, and Microsoft Windows. It also pointed out that targets are selected based on several factors, including the targeting of highrevenue companies that are more likely to pay up, the exploits available for gaining initial access, and geographic considerations. Threat Intelligence firm GreyNoise, in a parallel report, said it has observed active exploitation of 23 of the 62 CVEs, necessitating that customers move quickly to apply the necessary patches, if not already. Some of these CVEs have been actively exploited in just the past 24 hours, including critical flaws in Palo Alto PANOS, JetBrains TeamCity, Microsoft Exchange, and Cisco IOS XE, the company said . As of , the subset of CVEs targeted within the past 24 hours is as follows CVE202126855 Microsoft Exchange Server RCE ProxyLogon CVE202144228 Apache Log4j RCE Log4Shell CVE202230525 Zyxel Multiple Firewalls OS Command Injection CVE202241082 Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution CVE20234966 Citrix NetScaler ADC Buffer Overflow Citrix Bleed CVE202320198 Cisco IOS XE Web UI Privilege Escalation CVE202322515 Atlassian Confluence Broken Access Control CVE202336845 Juniper Junos OS PHP External Variable Control CVE20241709 ConnectWise ScreenConnect Authentication Bypass CVE20243400 Palo Alto Networks PANOS Command Injection CVE202424919 Check Point Quantum Security Gateways Information Disclosure CVE202427198 JetBrains TeamCity Authentication Bypass The story was updated after publication to include additional information about the CVEs used by Black Basta.

"Cybercrime Android Cybersecurity researchers have discovered an updated version of an Android malware called TgToxic aka ToxicPanda, indicating that the threat actors behind it are continuously making changes in response to public reporting. The modifications seen in the TgToxic payloads reflect the actors ongoing surveillance of open source intelligence and demonstrate their commitment to enhancing the malwares capabilities to improve security measures and keep researchers at bay, Intel 471 said in a report published this week. TgToxic was first documented by Trend Micro in early 2023, describing it as a banking trojan capable of stealing credentials and funds from crypto wallets as well as bank and finance apps. It has been detected in the wild since at least July 2022, mainly focusing on mobile users in Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia. Then in November 2024, Italian online fraud prevention firm Cleafy detailed an updated variant with wideranging datagathering features, while also expanding its operational scope to include Italy, Portugal, Hong Kong, Spain, and Peru. The malware is assessed to be the work of a Chinesespeaking threat actor. Intel 471s latest analysis has found that the malware is distributed via dropper APK files likely via SMS messages or phishing websites. However, the exact delivery mechanism remains unknown. Some of the notable improvements include improved emulator detection capabilities and updates to the commandandcontrol C2 URL generation mechanism, underscoring ongoing efforts to sidestep analysis efforts. The malware conducts a thorough evaluation of the devices hardware and system capabilities to detect emulation, Intel 471 said. The malware examines a set of device properties including brand, model, manufacturer and fingerprint values to identify discrepancies that are typical of emulated systems. Another significant change is the shift from hardcoded C2 domains embedded within the malwares configuration to using forums such as the Atlassian community developer forum to create bogus profiles that include an encrypted string pointing to the actual C2 server. The TgToxic APK is designed to randomly select one of the community forum URLs provided in the configuration, which serves as a dead drop resolver for the C2 domain. The technique offers several advantages, foremost being that it makes it easier for threat actors to change C2 servers by simply updating the community user profile to point to the new C2 domain without having to issue any updates to the malware itself. This method considerably extends the operational lifespan of malware samples, keeping them functional as long as the user profiles on these forums remain active, Intel 471 said. Subsequent iterations of TgToxic discovered in December 2024 go a step further, relying on a domain generation algorithm DGA to create new domain names for use as C2 servers. This makes the malware more resilient to disruption efforts as the DGA can be used to create several domain names, allowing the attackers to switch to a new domain even if some are taken down. TgToxic stands out as a highly sophisticated Android banking trojan due to its advanced antianalysis techniques, including obfuscation, payload encryption, and antiemulation mechanisms that evade detection by security tools, Approov CEO Ted Miracco said in a statement. Its use of dynamic commandandcontrol C2 strategies, such as domain generation algorithms DGA, and its automation capabilities enable it to hijack user interfaces, steal credentials, and perform unauthorized transactions with stealth and resilience against countermeasures.

"The Hacker News Artificial Intelligence Browser Security Organizations are either already adopting GenAI solutions, evaluating strategies for integrating these tools into their business plans, or both. To drive informed decisionmaking and effective planning, the availability of hard data is essentialyet such data remains surprisingly scarce. The Enterprise GenAI Data Security Report 2025 by LayerX delivers unprecedented insights into the practical application of AI tools in the workplace, while highlighting critical vulnerabilities. Drawing on realworld telemetry from LayerXs enterprise clients, this report is one of the few reliable sources that details actual employee use of GenAI. For instance, it reveals that nearly 90 of enterprise AI usage occurs outside the visibility of IT, exposing organizations to significant risks such as data leakage and unauthorized access. Below we bring some of the reports key findings. Read the full report to refine and enhance your security strategies, leverage datadriven decisionmaking for risk management, and evangelize for resources to enhance GenAI data protection measures. To register to a webinar that will cover the key findings in this report, click here . Use of GenAI in the Enterprise is Casual at Most for Now While the GenAI hype may make it seem like the entire workforce has transitioned their office operations to GenAI, LayerX finds the actual use a tad more lukewarm. Approximately 15 of users access GenAI tools on a daily basis. This is not a percentage to be ignored, but it is not the majority. Yet. Here at The New Stack we concur with LayerXs analysis, predicting this trend will accelerate quickly. Especially since 50 of users currently use GenAI every other week. In addition, they find that 39 of regular GenAI tool users are software developers, meaning that the highest potential of data leakage through GenAI is of source and proprietary code, as well as the risk of using risky code in your codebase. How is GenAI Being Used? Who Knows? Since LayerX is situated in the browser, the tool has visibility into the use of Shadow SaaS. This means they can see employees using tools that were not approved by the organizations IT or through noncorporate accounts. And while GenAI tools like ChatGPT are used for work purposes, nearly 72 of employees access them through their personal accounts. If employees do access through corporate accounts, only about 12 is done with SSO. As a result, nearly 90 of GenAI usage is invisible to the organization. This leaves organizations blind to shadow AI applications and the unsanctioned sharing of corporate information on AI tools. 50 of Pasting Activity intoGenAI Includes Corporate Data Remember the Pareto principle? In this case, while not all users use GenAI on a daily basis, users who do paste into GenAI applications, do so frequently and of potentially confidential information. LayerX found that pasting of corporate data occurs almost 4 times a day, on average, among users who submit data to GenAI tools. This could include business information, customer data, financial plans, source code, etc. How to Plan for GenAI Usage What Enterprises Must Do Now The findings in the report signal an urgent need for new security strategies to manage GenAI risk. Traditional security tools fail to address the modern AIdriven workplace where applications are browserbased. They lack the ability to detect, control, and secure AI interactions at the sourcethe browser. Browserbased security provides visibility into access to AI SaaS applications, unknown AI applications beyond ChatGOT, AIenabled browser extensions, and more. This visibility can be used to employ DLP solutions for GenAI, allowing enterprises to safely include GenAI in their plans, futureproofing their business.

"The Hacker News Hackers are constantly scanning your network, often spotting vulnerabilities before you do. Theyre looking for misconfigurations, exposed assets, and weak points that could lead to a breachare you seeing what they see? Every activity or interaction that your organization does online website, social media accounts, cloud services, thirdparty integrations, and more contributes to its digital footprint. This digital footprint is information attackers use to find your weaknesses and attempt to exploit them. What if you could anticipate how hackers plan to exploit your vulnerabilities before they strike? Imagine identifying the weaknesses most enticing to an attackerbefore they become exploited. Attack Surface Management ASM solutions help organizations continuously identify, monitor and manage aspects of publicfacing IT assets, including those that may be forgotten. ASM is the tool in the battle of visibility either you see your weaknesses first, or attackers will show you them by exploiting them. Sprocket Security, a premier offensive security provider, is bringing a unique perspective to Attack Surface Management the view of the hacker. Everything is about data. With the emergence of shared infrastructure arrangements, the attacker has more data and tools than ever before to take over assets. With comprehensive visibility, continuous monitoring, and risk prioritization, you can think like a hacker to reduce risk and expand visibility into your organizations digital footprint. Understanding ASM Key Components Effective ASM is ongoing and requires a strategy that involves many elements, such as identifying potential entry points that might be attractive to an attacker. This knowledge can be used to improve your overall security posture. Every organization needs to defend against known threats and proactively mitigate risks before theyre exploited. In this proactive approach, ASM can be a crucial risk management component that allows organizations to confidently continue expanding their publicfacing environments. Asset discovery The first step in building an ASM profile. During asset discovery, you will identify assets in your organizations publicfacing infrastructure. Attackers look for unmonitored or forgotten assets to exploit. In 2024, over 60 of breaches started with an exposed, unmonitored asset often as small as an old subdomain. In short, you cant protect things you dont know about. Continuous monitoring Performing an ongoing scan of your attack surface for new network services or exposed assets. Attackers look for the assets you forgot. Organizations using continuous monitoring and ASM technologies experienced a 50 decrease in the likelihood of successful attacks! Change Detection Change detection serves as a red flag that your attack surface has been modified. Modern IT environments change rapidly. These changes can be attractive to a threat actor or even caused by one!. Attackers can try to use an exploit that will go unnoticed as just another change. Change detection is useful to identify decommissioned assets, new IP addresses, open network ports, and service configuration changes. Source Sprocket Security Internal Data for 2024 Why You Should Map Your Attack Surface With an attackers mindset, ask yourself the question Do I know where the entry points to my network are? Discovery is the foundation for building a more comprehensive understanding of risk in publicfacing systems. Without this knowledge, a hackers toolkit will become infinitely more successful! Consider a few techniques a hacker might use and how you could combat them before the breach even begins Hackers Toolkit Port Scanning used to identify open ports and services. With this information, a hacker can identify exploitable entry points to gain access to your network. DNS reconnaissance process of gathering information about a domain through its DNS Domain Name System infrastructure. A hacker would discover hidden domains, subdomains, and other resources exposed through DNS records. Certificate analysis examining digital certificates used in network communications. Analyzing these certificates helps hackers identify weak points in a networks encryption infrastructure to be exploited. The Defenders Toolkit Continuous scanning an ongoing process of monitoring for threats in realtime. By constantly checking for vulnerabilities or weaknesses in your environment, you can catch exposures before an attacker. Realtime alerts notifications triggered instantly when a specific security event or incident occurs. Having realtime data allows your team to act immediately! ASM dashboards provides a centralized view of an organizations attack surface. With a dashboard, your security team will have full visibility into your attack surface to manage exposure to potential cyber threats. There are many more methods and techniques, including active and passive approaches, that a hacker will have at the ready, so a comprehensive defenders toolkit is important because it can turn discovery data into security insights. At Sprocket, our ASM provides continuous asset inventory, as seen from the attackers perspective, and a solution to discover publicfacing assets that you own, or an attacker has taken over via cybersquatting or more aggressive techniques. Source Sprocket ASM Tool Dashboard Why Tracking Attack Surface Changes is Critical You have your attack surface mapped, youre discovering vulnerabilities and patching them, now you must keep tracking changes? Why? Comprehensive discovery and realtime monitoring of your publicfacing attack surface is a critical component of Gartners Continuous Threat Exposure Management CTEM process. In the CTEM approach, realtime insights into potential exposures are fundamental. ASM offers proactive visibility, the potential for rapid response, and encourages ongoing maturity as your organization grows information security capabilities. You cant defend your assets if you dont have an accurate accounting of them. A multimethod approach is necessary to identify assets that are associated with your organization but might not be easily identified using a single method such as DNS analysis. Attack surfaces are not static. ASM is a continuous process that is especially critical for organizations that deploy frequently or manage large, complex infrastructures. Gain The Attacker Advantage With full visibility into your attack surface, you gain the upper hand. Now, you can pinpoint exactly where attackers might exploit vulnerabilities and identify which assets are at risk. This elevated insight strengthens your security posture to a whole new level.

"Mobile Security Spyware Cybersecurity researchers have flagged an updated version of the LightSpy implant that comes equipped with an expanded set of data collection features to extract information from social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. LightSpy is the name given to a modular spyware thats capable of infecting both Windows and Apple systems with an aim to harvest data. It was first documented in 2020, targeting users in Hong Kong. This includes WiFi network information, screenshots, location, iCloud Keychain, sound recordings, photos, browser history, contacts, call history, and SMS messages, and data from various apps like Files, LINE, Mail Master, Telegram, Tencent QQ, WeChat, and WhatsApp. Late last year, ThreatFabric detailed an updated version of the malware that incorporates destructive capabilities to prevent the compromised device from booting up, alongside expanding the number of supported plugins from 12 to 28. Previous findings have also uncovered potential overlaps between LightSpy and an Android malware named DragonEgg , highlighting the crossplatform nature of the threat. Hunt.ios latest analysis of the malicious commandandcontrol C2 infrastructure associated with the spyware has uncovered support for over 100 commands spanning Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, routers, and Linux. The new command list shifts focus from direct data collection to broader operational control, including transmission management 传输控制 and plugin version tracking 上传插件版本详细信息, the company said . These additions suggest a more flexible and adaptable framework, allowing LightSpy operators to manage deployments more efficiently across multiple platforms. Notable among the new commands is the ability to target Facebook and Instagram application database files for data extraction from Android devices. But in an interesting twist, the threat actors have removed iOS plugins associated with destructive actions on the victim host. Also discovered are 15 Windowsspecific plugins designed for system surveillance and data collection, with most of them geared towards keylogging, audio recording, and USB interaction. The threat intelligence firm said it also discovered an endpoint phonephoneinfo in the admin panel that grants loggedin users the ability to remotely control the infected mobile devices. Its currently not known if these represent new developments or previously undocumented older versions. The shift from targeting messaging applications to Facebook and Instagram expands LightSpys ability to collect private messages, contact lists, and account metadata from widely used social platforms, Hunt.io said. Extracting these database files could provide attackers with stored conversations, user connections, and potentially sessionrelated data, increasing surveillance capabilities and opportunities for further exploitation. The disclosure comes as Cyfirma disclosed details of an Android malware dubbed SpyLend that masquerades as a financial app named Finance Simplified APK name com.someca.count on the Google Play Store but engages in predatory lending, blackmail, and extortion aimed at Indian users. By leveraging locationbased targeting, the app displays a list of unauthorized loan apps that operate entirely within WebView, allowing attackers to bypass Play Store scrutiny, the company said . Once installed, these loan apps harvest sensitive user data, enforce exploitative lending practices, and employ blackmail tactics to extort money. Some of the advertised loan apps are KreditPro formerly KreditApple, MoneyAPE, StashFur, Fairbalance, and PokketMe. Users who install Finance Simplified from outside India are served a harmless WebView that lists various calculators for personal finance, accounting, and taxation, suggesting that the campaign is designed to specifically target Indian users. The app is no longer available for download from the official Android app marketplace. According to statistics available on Sensor Tower, the application was published around midDecember 2024 and attracted over 100,000 installations. Initially presented as a harmless finance management application, it downloads a fraud loan app from an external download URL, which once installed, gains extensive permissions to access sensitive data, including files, contacts, call logs, SMS, clipboard content, and even the camera, Cyfirma pointed out. Indian retail banking customers have also become the target of another campaign that distributes a malware codenamed FinStealer that impersonates legitimate bank apps, but is engineered to collect login credentials and facilitate financial fraud by carrying out unauthorized transactions. Distributed via phishing links, and social engineering, these fake apps closely mimic legitimate bank apps, tricking users into revealing credentials, financial data, and personal details, the company said . Using Telegram bots, the malware can receive instructions and send stolen data without raising suspicion, making it more difficult for security systems to detect and block the communication.

"The Hacker News Enterprise Security Attack Simulation Cyber threats evolvehas your defense strategy kept up? A new free guide available here explains why Continuous Threat Exposure Management CTEM is the smart approach for proactive cybersecurity. This concise report makes a clear business case for why CTEMs comprehensive approach is the best overall strategy for shoring up a businesss cyber defenses in the face of evolving attacks. It also presents a realworld scenario that illustrates how the business would fare against a formjacking attack under three security frameworks Vulnerability Management VM, Attack Surface Management ASM, and CTEM. With VM, the attack might go unnoticed for weeks. With CTEM, simulated attacks detect and neutralize it before it starts. Reassuringly, it also explains that CTEM builds on a businesss current VM and ASM solutions rather than requiring them to jettison anything they currently use. But first What is CTEM? In response to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, Gartner introduced Continuous Threat Exposure Management CTEM in 2022 as a more proactive security strategy. It laid out a fivestep sequence of phases VM and ASM Limitations With CTEMs holistic approach, security teams can assess both internal and external threats and respond based on business priorities. Part of the problem with relying on a VM framework is that it focuses on identifying and patching known vulnerabilities within a companys internal infrastructure. Its limited in scope and reactive by nature, so while this approach may be useful for dealing with an attack at the moment, VMoriented solutions dont look beyond that. ASM offers a wider scope but is still limited. It provides visibility into external assets but lacks continuous validation capabilities, as the report explains. CTEM combines the strengths of VM and ASM but also provides continuous monitoring, threat validation, attack simulation, penetration testing, and prioritization based on business impact. CTEM is More BusinessRelevant For CISOs, prioritizing security efforts based on business impact is critical. Modern websites are highly dynamic, so security teams dont have the time to block and investigate every single change that might occur without severely limiting website functionality and negatively affecting the business. CTEM seeks to strike a balance between the competing demands of risk and cost by identifying and prioritizing the most potentially damaging risk factors. The level of risk that each business is willing to accept is referred to as its risk appetite , and by implementing a CTEM solution, it can respond to the threats it faces according to its own unique definition of where that level lies. CTEM is a mature and effective strategy for managing todays complex threat landscape, and while it can unlock better security costeffectively, it does require strategic implementation. There are various CTEM solutions on the market that will fulfill the requirements of some or all of the implementation stages, and the downloadable PDF lists several of them as well as a selection of VM and ASM solutions. A good one will map all assets in a websites digital infrastructure and monitor them for the kind of changes that signal the start of Magecart , ransomware, and other attacks, deliver timely alerts according to the companys risk appetite, assist with compliance monitoring, and more. Download the guide now to learn how CTEM can proactively protect your business from formjacking, ransomware, and other advanced threats. Found this article interesting?

"Surveillance Content Monitoring An analysis of a data leak from a Chinese cybersecurity company TopSec has revealed that it likely offers censorshipasaservice solutions to prospective customers, including a stateowned enterprise in the country. Founded in 1995, TopSec ostensibly offers services such as Endpoint Detection and Response EDR and vulnerability scanning. But its also providing boutique solutions in order to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements, SentinelOne researchers Alex Delamotte and Aleksandar Milenkoski said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The data leak contains infrastructure details and work logs from employees, as well as references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers. Its believed that the company provided bespoke monitoring services to a stateowned enterprise hit by a corruption scandal, indicating that such platforms are being used to monitor and control public opinion as necessary. Present among the data leak is a contract for a Cloud Monitoring Service Project announced by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau in September 2024. The project, the document reveals, involves continuous monitoring of websites within the Bureaus jurisdiction with the goal of identifying security issues and content changes, and providing incident alerts. Specifically, the platform has been designed to look for the presence of hidden links in web content, along with those containing sensitive words related to political criticism, violence, or pornography. While the exact goals are unclear, its suspected that such alerts could be used by customers to take followon actions, such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. That said, Shanghai Anheng Smart City Security Technology Co. Ltd. won the contract, per public documents analyzed by SentinelOne. The cybersecurity firm said the leak was detected after it analyzed a text file that was uploaded to the VirusTotal platform on . The manner in which the data was leaked remains unclear. The main file we analyzed contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task, the researchers noted. In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSecs services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. Also found are references to another framework named Sparta or Sparda thats supposedly designed to handle sensitive word processing by receiving content from downstream web applications via GraphQL APIs, once again suggestive of censorship keyword monitoring. These leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and Chinas private sector cybersecurity companies, the researchers said. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the states grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.

"Welcome to your weekly roundup of cyber news, where every headline gives you a peek into the world of online battles. This week, we look at a huge crypto theft, reveal some sneaky AI scam tricks, and discuss big changes in data protection. Let these stories spark your interest and help you understand the changing threats in our digital world. Threat of the Week Lazarus Group Linked to RecordSetting 1.5 Billion Crypto Theft The North Korean Lazarus Group has been linked to a sophisticated attack that led to the theft of over 1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency from one of Bybits cold wallets, making it the largest ever single crypto heist in history. Bybit said it detected unauthorized activity within one of our Ethereum ETH Cold Wallets during a planned routine transfer process on , at around 1230 p.m. UTC. The incident makes it the biggestever cryptocurrency heist reported to date, dwarfing that of Ronin Network 624 million, Poly Network 611 million, and BNB Bridge 586 million. Automate Manual Processes Close Deals Faster with Drata From cost center to revenue driver, now is the time to transition to a modern approach to GRC. Drata delivers the worlds most advanced Trust Management platform making risk and compliance accessible, continuous, and 10x more automated than ever before. Download Report Top News OpenAI Bans ChatGPT Accounts for Malicious Activities OpenAI has revealed that it banned several clusters of accounts that used its ChatGPT tool for a wide range of malicious purposes. This included a network likely originating from China that used its artificial intelligence AI models to develop a suspected surveillance tool thats designed to ingest and analyze posts and comments from platforms such as X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, and Reddit. Other instances of ChatGPT abuse consisted of creating social media content and longform articles critical of the U.S., generating comments for propagating romancebaiting scams on social media, and assisting with malware development. Apple Drops iClouds Advanced Data Protection in the U.K. Apple has stopped offering its Advanced Data Protection ADP feature for iCloud in the United Kingdom with immediate effect, rather than complying with government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy, the company said. The development comes shortly after reports emerged that the U.K. government had ordered Apple to build a backdoor that grants blanket access to any Apple users iCloud content. Salt Typhoon Leverages YearsOld Cisco Flaw for Initial Access The Chinalinked hacking group called Salt Typhoon leveraged a nowpatched security flaw impacting Cisco devices CVE20180171 and obtaining legitimate victim login credentials as part of a targeted campaign aimed at major U.S. telecommunications companies. Besides relying extensively on livingofftheland LOTL techniques to evade detection, the attacks have led to the deployment of a bespoke utility called JumbledPath that allows them to execute a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actordefined jumphost. Cisco described the threat actor as highly sophisticated and wellfunded, consistent with statesponsored hacking activity. Russian Hackers Exploit Signals Linking Feature Multiple Russiaaligned threat actors have been observed targeting individuals of interest via malicious QR codes that exploit the privacyfocused messaging app Signals linked devices feature to gain unauthorized access to their accounts and eavesdrop on the messages. The attacks have been attributed to two clusters tracked as UNC5792 and UNC4221. The development comes as similar attacks have also been recorded against WhatsApp. Winnti Stages RevivalStone Campaign Targeting Japan Winnti, a subgroup with the APT41 Chinese threat activity cluster, targeted Japanese companies in the manufacturing, materials, and energy sectors in March 2024 that delivered a wide range of malware, including a rootkit thats capable of intercepting TCPIP Network Interface, as well as creating covert channels with infected endpoints within the intranet. The activity has been codenamed RevivalStone. Trending CVEs Your goto software could be hiding dangerous security flawsdont wait until its too late!

Around the Cyber World U.S. Army Soldier Pleads Guilty to ATT and Verizon Hacks Cameron John Wagenius aka Kiberphant0m, a 20yearold U.S. Army soldier, who was arrested early last month over ATT and Verizon hacking, has pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records information in 2024. He faces up to 10 years of prison for each count. Wagenius is also believed to have collaborated with Connor Riley Moucka aka Judische and John Binns, both of whom have been accused of stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies by breaking into their Snowflake instances. Two Estonian Nationals Plead Guilty in 577M Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme Two Estonian nationals, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin, both 40, have pleaded guilty for the operation of a massive, multifaceted cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme that claimed hundreds of thousands of people from across the world, including in the U.S. They have also agreed to forfeit assets valued over 400 million obtained during the operation of the illicit scheme. The defendants sold contracts to customers entitling them to a share of cryptocurrency mined by the defendants purported cryptocurrency mining service, HashFlare, the Justice Department said . Between 2015 and 2019, Hashflares sales totaled more than 577 million, but HashFlare did not possess the requisite computing capacity to perform the vast majority of the mining the defendants told HashFlare customers it performed. Potapenko and Turõgin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The disclosure comes as Indian law enforcement authorities seized nearly 190 million in cryptocurrency tied to the BitConnect scam. BitConnect is estimated to have defrauded over 4,000 investors across 95 countries, amassing 2.4 billion before its collapse in 2018. Its founder Satish Kumbhani was charged by the U.S. in 2022, but he remained a fugitive until his whereabouts were traced to Ahmedabad. Thailand Rescues 7,000 People from Myanmar Call Centers Thailand Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said some 7,000 people have been rescued from illegal call center operations in Myanmar, and are waiting to be transferred to the country. In recent years, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos have become hotspots for illicit romance baiting scams , with most of them run by organized cybercrime syndicates and staffed by people who were illegally trafficked into the region under the promise of highpaying jobs. They are then tortured and enslaved into running scams such as romance fraud and fake investment schemes online. We are facing an epidemic in the growth of financial fraud, leading to individuals, often vulnerable people, and companies being defrauded on a massive and global scale, INTERPOL noted last year. The United Nations estimated that scams targeting victims across East and Southeast Asia caused financial losses between 18 billion and 37 billion in 2023. Sanctioned Entities Fueled 16 billion in Crypto Activity Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions were responsible for nearly 115.8 billion in cryptocurrency activity last year, accounting for about 39 of all illicit crypto transactions. In a departure from prior years, sanctioned jurisdictions accounted for a record share of total sanctionsrelated activity compared to individual entities, commanding nearly 60 of value by the end of 2024, Chainalysis said. This is driven by the continued emergence of noKYC exchanges despite enforcement actions, as well as the resurgence of Tornado Cash, which has been the target of sanctions and arrests. The increase in Tornado Cash usage in 2024 was largely driven by stolen funds, which reached a threeyear high, accounting for 24.4 of total inflows, the blockchain intelligence firm said . Another notable factor is the increasing use of digital currencies by Iranian services for sanctionsrelated crypto activity. Cryptocurrency outflows from Iran reached 4.18 billion in 2024, up about 70 yearoveryear. U.S. Releases Russian Cybercriminal in Prison Swap Alexander Vinnik, who pleaded guilty last year to money laundering charges in connection with operating the nowdismantled BTCe cryptocurrency exchange, has been handed over by the U.S. government to Russia in exchange for Marc Fogel, a school teacher sentenced to 14 years in prison for drug trafficking charges. He was originally arrested in Greece in 2017. His sentencing was scheduled to take place in June 2025. Black Hat SEO Campaign Targets Indian Sites Threat actors have infiltrated Indian government, educational, and financial services websites, using malicious JavaScript code that leverage search engine optimization SEO poisoning techniques to redirect users to sketchy websites promoting online betting and other investmentfocused games that claim to offer referral bonus. Targets of interest include websites with .gov.in , .ac.in TLDs and the usage of keyword stuffing mentioning well known financial brands in India, CloudSEK said . Over 150 government portals, most belonging to state governments, have been affected at scale. Its currently not known how these websites are being compromised. A similar campaign targeting Malaysian government websites has also been reported in the past. Sky ECC Distributors Arrested in Spain, Netherlands Four distributors of the encrypted communications service Sky ECC , which was used extensively by criminals, have been arrested in Spain and the Netherlands. The two suspects arrested in Spain are said to be the leading global distributors of the service, generating over 13.5 million 14 million in profits. In March 2021, Europol announced that it was able to crack open Sky ECCs encryption, thereby allowing law enforcement to monitor the communications of 70,000 users and expose the criminal activity occurring on the platform.In late January, the Dutch Police announced the arrest of two men from Amsterdam and Arnhem for allegedly selling Sky ECC phones in the country. Italian Spyware Maker Linked to Malicious WhatsApp Clones An Italian spyware company named SIO, which offers solutions for monitoring suspect activities, gathering intelligence, or conducting covert operations, has been attributed as behind malicious Android apps that impersonate WhatsApp and other popular apps and are designed to steal private data from a targets device. The findings, reported by TechCrunch, demonstrate the various methods used to deploy such invasive software against individuals of interest. The spyware, codenamed Spyrtacus, can steal text messages, instant messaging chats, contacts, call logs, ambient audio, and images, among others. Its currently not known who was targeted with the spyware. The oldest artifact, per Lookout, dates back to 2019 and the most recent sample was discovered in midOctober 2024. Interestingly, Kaspersky revealed in May 2024 that it observed Spyrtacus being used to target individuals in Italy, stating it shared similarities with another stalkerware malware named HelloSpy. The threat actor first started distributing the malicious APK via Google Play in 2018, but switched to malicious web pages forged to imitate legitimate resources relating to the most common Italian internet service providers in 2019, the company said . The development comes as iVerify said it discovered 11 new cases of Pegasus spyware infection in December 2024 that go beyond politicians and activists. The new confirmed detections, involving known variants of Pegasus from 20212023, include attacks against users across government, finance, logistics, and real estate industries, iVerify said , adding in about half the cases, the victims did not receive any Threat Notifications from Apple. CryptoBytes Unleashes UxCryptor Malware The financially motivated Russian threat actor known as CryptoBytes has been linked to a new ransomware called UxCryptor that uses leaked builders to create and distribute their malware. The group is active since at least 2023. UxCryptor is part of a broader trend of ransomware families that use leaked builders, making it accessible to less technically skilled malware operators, the SonicWall Capture Labs threat research team said . It is often delivered alongside other malware types, such as Remote Access Trojans RATs or information stealers, to maximize the impact of an attack. The malware is designed to encrypt files on the victims system, demanding payment in cryptocurrency for decryption. Threat Actors Take a Mere 48 Minutes to Go From Initial Access to Lateral Movement Cybersecurity company ReliaQuest, which recently responded to a manufacturing sector breach involving phishing and data exfiltration, said the attack achieved a breakout time of just 48 minutes, indicating that adversaries are moving faster than defenders can respond. The attack involved the use of email bombing techniques reminiscent of Black Basta ransomware , followed by sending a Microsoft Teams message to trick victims into granting them remote access via Quick Assist . One user granted the threat actor control of their machine for over 10 minutes, giving the threat actor ample time to progress their attack, ReliaQuest said . Russia Plans New Measures to Tackle Cybercrime The Russian government is said to have approved a series of measures aimed at combating cyber fraud. This includes tougher punishments for attackers, longer prison terms, and strengthening international cooperation by allowing the extradition of criminals hiding abroad to Russia for trial and punishment.

"Dark Web Cybercrime The threat actors behind the Darcula phishingasaservice PhaaS platform appear to be readying a new version that allows prospective customers and cyber crooks to clone any brands legitimate website and create a phishing version, further bringing down the technical expertise required to pull off phishing attacks at scale. The latest iteration of the phishing suite represents a significant shift in criminal capabilities, reducing the barrier to entry for bad actors to target any brand with complex, customizable phishing campaigns, Netcraft said in a new analysis. The cybersecurity company said it has detected and blocked more than 95,000 new Darcula phishing domains, nearly 31,000 IP addresses, and taken down more than 20,000 fraudulent websites since it was first exposed in late March 2024. The biggest change incorporated into Darcula is the ability for any user to generate a phishing kit for any brand in an ondemand fashion. The new and remastered version is now ready for testing, the core developers behind the service said in a post made on , in a Telegram channel that has over 1,200 subscribers. Now, you can also customize the frontend yourself. Using darculasuite, you can complete the production of a frontend in 10 minutes. To do this, all a customer has to do is provide the URL of the brand to be impersonated in a web interface, with the platform employing a browser automation tool like Puppeteer to export the HTML and all required assets. Users can then select the HTML element to replace and inject the phishing content e.g., payment forms and login fields such that it matches the look and feel of the branded landing page. The generated phishing page is then uploaded to an admin panel. Like any SoftwareasaService product, the darculasuite PhaaS platform provides admin dashboards that make it simple for fraudsters to manage their various campaigns, security researcher Harry Freeborough said. Once generated, these kits are uploaded to another platform where criminals can manage their active campaigns, find extracted data, and monitor their deployed phishing campaigns. Besides featuring dashboards that highlight the aggregated performance statistics of the phishing campaigns, Darcula v3 goes a step further by offering a way to convert the stolen credit card details into a virtual image of the victims card that can be scanned and added to a digital wallet for illicit purposes. Specifically, the cards are loaded onto burner phones and sold to other criminals. The tool is said to be currently in the internal testing stage. In a followup post dated , the malware author posted the message I have been busy these days, so the v3 update will be postponed for a few days. Found this article interesting?

"Data Protection Encryption Apple is removing its Advanced Data Protection ADP feature for iCloud from the United Kingdom with immediate effect following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data. The development was first reported by Bloomberg. ADP for iCloud is an optional setting that ensures that users trusted devices retain sole access to the encryption keys used to unlock data stored in its cloud. This includes iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, voice memos, and data associated with its own apps. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy, the company was quoted as saying to Bloomberg. ADP protects iCloud data with endtoend encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices. Customers who are already using ADP will need to manually disable it for an asyetunspecified period of time, per the report, as Apple does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf. The unprecedented development comes merely weeks after reports emerged that the U.K. government had ordered Apple to build a backdoor to access any Apple users iCloud content. Per The Washington Post, the demand, issued by the U.K. Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act IPA aka the Snoopers Charter, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account. With the removal of ADP in the region, Apple now only offers standard data protection for iCloud, which encrypts users data but stores the encryption keys in its own data centers, thereby making it accessible to law enforcement subject to a warrant. Last week, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Member of Congress Andy Biggs sent a letter to Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, urging the U.K. to retract its order, citing it threatens the privacy and security of both the American people and the U.S. government. If the U.K. does not immediately reverse this dangerous effort, we urge you to reevaluate U.S.U.K. cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as U.S. intelligence sharing with the U.K., they added.

"The Hacker News Since Russias latest escalation in 2022 with its invasion of Ukraine, hacktivism has surged, impacting both private and public sectors through DDoS attacks, defacements, and disinformation campaigns. These cyberattacks align with geopolitical events. As 2024 saw over 50 countries holding elections, this creates particularly ripe conditions for influence operations such as misinformation and propaganda campaigns. DDoS attacks have also intensified, with one proRussian hacktivist group alone claiming over 6,000 attacks since March 2022. Driven by political tensions and geopolitical conflicts, we saw a significant increase in both volume and intensity. Hacktivists are now more experienced, leveraging DDoSforhire services and sophisticated tools. To better understand the complex threat landscape, we aim to explore current hacktivism more deeply, examining its various facets and connections to geopolitical tensions, building on our previous findings. This article doesnt cover all actors or activities from the past year. Our perspective, shaped by Western, Englishlanguage viewpoints, may limit our understanding of the broader phenomenon. We avoid naming the Hacktivist group we primarily examine, as it thrives on attention. Historical Context of hacktivism Hacktivism has evolved through three key eras. The first, the Digital Utopia era, was driven by ideals of building a better internet, as seen with groups like Chaos Computer Club CCC. Next came the AntiEstablishment era, where hacktivists exposed the flaws in how cyberspace developed, often opposing entrenched powers. The current era however sees groups shifting from antiestablishment actions to aligning with certain state agendas. This is a massive paradigm shift from traditional hacktivism, which rejected state control. Instead, we see statesponsored activities that transform into operations of cyber warfare rather than traditional hacktivism. Evaluating the evolution of these groups offers key insights into the factors shaping todays hacktivists. Understanding how modern hacktivism differs from activities in the past reveals a striking change in motivation, which can ultimately help in developing better strategies for defense. Modern hacktivism In the modern era, hacktivists utilize more advanced techniques than in the past. This is partly due to technological advancements and the sharing of skills and tools in the shared economy model albeit at times with malicious intent, and partly because statesupported hacktivists might have opportunities to tap into better resources. DDoS attacks have consequently scaled exponentially in size and sophistication, with modern groups claiming and executing DDoS attacks that generate billions of requests per second or consume 3.8 terabits per second Tbps in bandwidth. We also observe a significant shift in the operational methods of hacktivist groups, especially a growing reliance on DDoSforhire services and crowdsourced DDoS tools. The volunteerbased nature of these groups enables them to scale attacks more effectively, as participants need minimal technical expertise and are incentivized through cryptocurrency rewards. This is an interesting shift since early hacktivist movements were primarily motivated by ideological or political causes, rather than financial rewards. One explanation for this is that as the cybercrime economy evolved and DDoSforhire services became more accessible, the line between financially motivated attackers and ideologically driven hacktivists began to blur. Hacktivists in this era also started to cross the line to impacting critical infrastructure and Operational Technology OT systems previously the domain of organized cybercrime or more regular state actors. Today, hacktivist groups operate in smaller, and more independent groups and many of the more prominent hacktivist groups align themselves with major powers, allowing them to operate with less fear of authorities and prosecution compared to groups from previous eras.

Stay one step ahead in cybersecurity. Your essential guide awaits! Get Your Copy Now While most observed hacktivism attacks still focus on IT systems, the aim of hacktivism seems to be multipurposed these days. On one side, cyberattacks aim to disrupt on the other hand, attacks are increasingly about shaping public opinion and spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt FUD through targeted manipulative campaigns. For instance, information operations in the Nordics escalated tensions during Swedens and Finlands NATO accession. Modern hacktivists have shifted from antigovernment positions, like opposing censorship, to supporting progovernment agendas through cyber operations. Unlike earlier hacktivists who focused on individual rights and ethics, todays groups often lack a history of activism. In this new era, traditional hacktivism which still operates and focuses on access to information, privacy, fighting oppression, and advocating for ethical use of technology, is overshadowed. Case Study How does modern hacktivism look? This study analyzes one of the most active proRussian hacktivist groups since March 2022, focusing on its communication strategies, narrative construction, and geopolitical influence. It also examines the groups alignment with state actors, values, and its role within the broader ecosystem. While this report focuses on just this one group, its prominence among peers offers valuable insights into similar progovernment hacktivist groups, allowing the study to reflect broader behaviors and tactics seen across this threat actor landscape. Data collection Our data was collected through the systematic scraping of the hacktivist groups Telegram channel monthly over a period of two years, from August 2022 to August 2024. The dataset renders 3,214 unique messages These messages included descriptions of the groups targets and other contents the group felt to share with the broader public. Thus, the messages serve to capture the groups narratives. 6,674 unique targets These targets encompass a wide range of entities attacked by the group, provided and proven by the actors by posting a checkhost link an internet monitoring service commonly used by hacktivists as proof of the success of their Service DDoS attacks. To ensure data consistency, scraping was conducted at the same time each month. The data includes textual content reasons for targeting, metadata timestamps, views, forwards, and contextual information about the targets. After processing, the exact number of targeted organizations and countries was determined. Data processing To analyze the communication patterns and geopolitical context of the hacktivist group, we analyzed the textual content of each message using natural language processing NLP. We applied text preprocessing and named entity recognition NER to identify country references, refining the results with a list of known countries and nationalities. The extracted country information was added to the dataset, allowing us to examine the groups geopolitical focus and alignments. Analysis Before discussing the data, its important to summarize recurring themes in proRussian Telegram posts. These narratives arent unique to one group but are common across several proRussian cyber actors. The group frames its actions as retaliation for Russophobia, Western support for Ukraine, or sanctions on Russia. Messages often mock targeted nations, criticizing leaders for prioritizing Ukraine over domestic issues. They use militaristic language, praising Russias military and positioning themselves as cyber warriors defending Russias interests, and aligning with broader narratives of resisting Western influence. The group occasionally references subscriber requests and volunteer input, showing they incorporate follower feedback when selecting targets. This fosters community involvement and introduces a crowdsourcing aspect to their cyber operations. Victimology The groups activities against targets serve both as a disruption tool and a symbolic statement against specific nations. By attacking organizations tied to everyday services, they retaliate against perceived wrongs and express disapproval of the nations political stance, particularly regarding Russia and Ukraine. Their strategy aims to influence international perception while creating domestic instability. Attacks on services like public transport or banking systems highlight institutional vulnerability, reinforcing the narrative that the state is failing to protect its citizens. Consequently, it doesnt necessarily matter who the victim is at an operational levelits more about what the organization symbolically represents in the context of a broader political or geopolitical message. What does the data tell us? In the following paragraphs, we analyze how many targets this specific hacktivist group has attacked over a twoyear period. Within the 3,214 messages, we identified 6,674 targets from the private and public sectors, averaging around 280 targets per month. The volume of messages fluctuated, potentially suggesting organized campaigns, likely timed to align with key political or military events. The groups focus appears to shift in response to geopolitical tensions, elections, or other notable events, reflecting a calculated effort to exert influence. This we will investigate below under Geopolitical impacts. In September and October 2023, we see a significant increase in activity. Analysis of the message contents indicates that Germany, Finland, the Czech Republic, Canada, the United Kingdom and Sweden were particularly heavily impacted. This surge coincides with key events such as national holidays e.g. Czech Republics national day, international meetings such as the Malta Peace Formula meeting and highprofile scandals such as the Canadian Parliament incident. The alignment allows the group to frame these cyber operations as symbolic acts of punishment. Top 25 Targeted Countries Our data shows that 42 distinct countries were targeted by this threat actor over two years, with 96 located in Europe. The attacks targeted countries rather than specific organizations. This becomes clear when analyzing the messages where the actors address the country they intended to impact, while at the same time posting a list of organizations that are meant to deliver the strategic message to a particular country and its civil society. In the context of the war against Ukraine, Ukraine and Eastern European countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Lithuania are heavily targeted. Western European nations such as Germany, Italy, and France also faced significant attacks, reflecting their NATO and EU leadership roles. In France, the group exploited social unrest, aligning with local farmer protest movements and public dissent. A surge in Spanish victims was triggered by the arrest of two individuals in Spain tied to the group. Similarly, attacks on Germany carried antigovernment sentiment and opposition to its leadership. As the rallies continue to rage in France, we support the farmers protesters and put down the communes 26th of January 2024 Finland and Moldova stand out for high attack volumes despite less direct involvement in the war against Ukraine. Finlands NATO membership and geographic proximity to Russia drew increased attention, but Moldova saw almost 200 attacks in Q2 2024, primarily DDoS attacks targeting state infrastructure and fueled by antigovernment sentiment. Moldovas vulnerability due to Transnistria likely contributes to its ranking. Spain and Italy also face frequent attacks, apparently in retaliation for their military support of Ukraine. Attacks focus on critical infrastructure and exploit internal dissent and are often framed as responses to Russophobia and arrests of Russian sympathizers. Canada ranks unusually high among nonEuropean targets, reflecting Russias global cyber reach against NATOaligned countries. The absence of the U.S. is notable, given its leading role in supporting Ukraine. ProRussian hacktivists may focus on European countries due to their proximity to the conflict, where disrupting supply chains and infrastructure more directly impacts Ukraine. Attacks on key transit hubs like Poland, or influential nations like Germany and France possibly offer more immediate strategic gains than targeting the U.S. Geopolitical impacts To analyze factors influencing target choices, we first identified relevant keywords linked to geopolitical events and extracted unique messages containing these keywords. Each message was then manually reviewed to confirm references to specific geopolitical events. This process enabled a focused analysis of how realworld developments have shaped the groups decisions. Our analysis reveals consistent support for antiEU protests. In particular, the Farmers Protests in Poland, Belgium, and Germany. Multiple European elections United Kingdom, France, Finland, Austria, Belgium and national independence days Ukraine and Poland were frequent themes. Election interference marked an escalation, aiming to disrupt democratic processes. The group also reacted to international conferences, targeting host countries or responding to specific comments made at these events. Election interference represents an escalation beyond typical DDoS attacks on infrastructure or military websites, as it directly targets the democratic process of a nation. By attacking electionrelated websites and portals, the hacktivist group aims to undermine public trust in the electoral system, disrupt the flow of information, and potentially influence the outcome of a key democratic process. The group frequently responded to international conferences or summits by targeting the host country with cyberattacks. Occasionally, specific comments made during these events also triggered attacks against the countries involved. A summary of the events associated with selected keywords is depicted in the following graphic. Summary We observed this particular proRussian hacktivist group for 2.5 years, since it began operations following the beginning of Russias war against Ukraine. Between August 2022 and August 2024, the group claimed over 6,600 attacks in more than 3,200 messages, with 96 of their victims in Europe, aligning with their antiNATO and antiWestern stance. Surprisingly, despite frequent mentions, no attacks were observed on U.S. targets, possibly signaling an intentional avoidance. The group focuses on sectors providing essential services, such as financial, transportation, education, and government systems, with the aim of disrupting societal stability. Notably, voting systems in countries like France, the UK, Finland, Belgium and Austria were targeted during elections, threatening electoral integrity and sowing doubt about results. These attacks align closely with Russian state narratives, suggesting potential state influence. Hacktivism has evolved from its early roots of ideological protest, with modern groups blurring the lines between hacktivism and statesponsored cybercriminal activities. The proRussian groups actions are symbolically tied to their targets, amplifying political messages or undermining public trust. Their campaigns often coincide with significant geopolitical events such as elections and summits. Like cyber extortion groups that threaten to leak sensitive data, hacktivists wield coercion to manipulate public perception, seeking to shape political outcomes. Indeed, several fundamental similarities between modern hacktivism and cyber extortion can be observed Both invest heavily in building a brand and community for credibility. Both operate publicly, offering realtime commentary on platforms like Telegram. Both are tolerated or even supported by nationstates when aligned with political objectives. Both procure advanced tools or services in the dark economy to boost capabilities. Both justify target selection retroactively, shaping narratives postattack to maintain control over the story. Both use coercion, with hacktivism aiming to influence political outcomes and cyber extortion threatening reputational damage through document leaks. Defending against these threats requires not only robust technical defenses but also strategic communication to counter disinformation and maintain public trust. The cognitive element of these attacks underscores the need for a holistic approach that includes safeguarding information integrity and strengthening public resilience. Recommendations From a technical standpoint Implement standard security controls like DDoS protection, vulnerability mitigation, and attack surface management. Continuously monitor evolving threats and use the latest threat intelligence. Develop incident response and crisis management plans that cover both technical recovery and public communications. Engage in strategies to counter cognitive attacks that target public perception and trust Monitor social and media channels for disinformation and respond quickly to debunk false claims. Communicate proactively with transparent updates to maintain stakeholder trust. Collaborate with public relations experts to craft consistent, credible messaging. Educate the public to recognize disinformation, fostering resilience against manipulation. Given the escalation of hacktivism, particularly proRussian attacks targeting the West and NATO, organizations in these regions should prepare for ongoing efforts to disrupt and destabilize.

"Linux Endpoint Security Universities and government organizations in North America and Asia have been targeted by a previously undocumented Linux malware called AutoColor between November and December 2024, according to new findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42. Once installed, Autocolor allows threat actors full remote access to compromised machines, making it very difficult to remove without specialized software, security researcher Alex Armstrong said in a technical writeup of the malware. Autocolor is so named based on the file name the initial payload renames itself post installation. Its currently not known how it reaches its targets, but whats known is that it requires the victim to explicitly run it on their Linux machine. A notable aspect of the malware is the arsenal of tricks it employs to evade detection. This includes using seeminglyinnocuous file names like door or egg, concealing commandandcontrol C2 connections, and leveraging proprietary encryption algorithms for masking communication and configuration information. Once launched with root privileges, it proceeds to install a malicious library implant named libcext.so.2, copies and renames itself to varlogcrossautocolor, and makes modifications to etcld.preload for establishing persistence on the host. If the current user lacks root privileges, the malware will not proceed with the installation of the evasive library implant on the system, Armstrong said. It will proceed to do as much as possible in its later phases without this library. The library implant is equipped to passively hook functions used in libc to intercept the open system call , which it uses to hide C2 communications by modifying procnettcp, a file that contains information on all active network connections. A similar technique was adopted by another Linux malware called Symbiote . It also prevents uninstallation of the malware by protecting the etcld.preload against further modification or removal. Autocolor then proceeds to contact a C2 server, granting the operator the ability to spawn a reverse shell, gather system information, create or modify files, run programs, use the machine as a proxy for communication between a remote IP address and a specific target IP address, and even uninstall itself by means of a kill switch. Upon execution, the malware attempts to receive remote instructions from a command server that can create reverse shell backdoors on the victims system, Armstrong said. The threat actors separately compile and encrypt each command server IP using a proprietary algorithm. Found this article interesting?

"The Hacker News Identity Protection Password Security Passwords are rarely appreciated until a security breach occurs suffice to say, the importance of a strong password becomes clear only when faced with the consequences of a weak one. However, most end users are unaware of just how vulnerable their passwords are to the most common passwordcracking methods. The following are the three common techniques for cracking passwords and how to defend against them. Brute force attack Brute force attacks are straightforward yet highly effective techniques for cracking passwords. These attacks involve malicious actors using automated tools to systematically try every possible password combination through repeated login attempts. While such tools have existed for years, the advent of affordable computing power and storage has made them even more efficient today, especially when weak passwords are used. How it works When it comes to brute force attacks, malicious actors employ a range of tacticsfrom simple brute force attacks that test every possible password combination to more nuanced approaches like hybrid and reverse brute force attacks. Each method has a distinct strategy behind it, but the motives behind brute force attacks are the same to gain unauthorized access to protected data or resources. Some popular automated tools for carrying out brute force attacks include John the Ripper a multiplatform password cracker with support for 15 different operating systems and hundreds of hashes and cipher types L0phtCrack a tool that uses rainbow tables, dictionaries, and multiprocessor algorithms to crack Windows passwords Hashcat a crackingpassword recovery utility that supports five unique modes of attack for over 300 highlyoptimized hashing algorithms Examples Back in August 2021, U.S. mobile operator TMobile fell victim to a data breach that started with a brute force attack. The security compromise resulted in the exposure of over 37 million customer records containing sensitive data like social security numbers, drivers license information, and other personally identifiable data. Defense measures Users should choose strong, complex passwords and multifactor authentication MFA to protect against brute force attacks. Administrators should implement account lockout policies and continuously audit their Windows environments for weak and breached passwords. Tools like Specops Password Auditor can automate these processes across expansive IT environments. Dictionary attack In a password dictionary attack, cyber attackers try to gain access by using a list of common passwords or words from a dictionary. This predefined word list typically includes the most often used words, phrases, and simple combinations i.e., admin123. Password dictionary attacks underscore the importance of complex, unique passwords, as these attack types are especially effective against weak or easily guessable passwords. How it works The process starts with compiling a list of potential passwords from data breaches, common password lists, or publicly available resources. Using an automated tool, malicious actors perform a dictionary attack, systematically testing each password against a target account or system. If a match is found, the hacker can gain access and carry out subsequent attacks or movements. Examples Malicious actors used password dictionaries to crack hashed passwords in several highprofile security incidents, such as the 2013 Yahoo data breach and the 2012 LinkedIn data breach . This allowed them to steal the account information of billions of users. Defense measures When creating or resetting passwords , users should use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid using common words or easily guessable phrases. Administrators can implement password complexity requirements in their policies to enforce these mandates across the organization. Rainbow table attacks A rainbow table attack uses a special table i.e., a Rainbow Table made up of precomputed strings or commonly used passwords and corresponding hashes to crack the password hashes in a database. How it works Rainbow table attacks work by exploiting chains of hashing and reduction operations to efficiently crack hashed passwords. Potential passwords are first hashed and stored alongside their plaintext counterparts in the rainbow table, then processed with a reduction function that maps them to new values, resulting in a chain of hashes. This process is repeated multiple times to build the rainbow table. When hackers obtain a hash list , they can reverse lookup each hash value in the rainbow tableonce a match is identified, the corresponding plaintext password is exposed. Examples While salting a method of adding random characters to passwords before hashing has reduced the effectiveness of rainbow table attacks, many hashes remain unsalted additionally, advances in GPUs and affordable hardware have eliminated the storage limitations once associated with rainbow tables. As a result, these attacks continue to be a likely tactic in current and future highprofile cyberattacks. Defense measures As mentioned previously, salted hashes have significantly reduced the effectiveness of precomputed tables organizations should therefore implement strong hashing algorithms e.g., bcrypt, scrypt in their password processes. Administrators should also regularly update and rotate passwords to reduce the likelihood of rainbow table dictionary matcheshits. In short, passwords arent perfect, but complex and sufficiently long passphrases remain a vital first line of defense against advanced passwordcracking techniques. Tools like Specops Policy provide an extra layer of protection by continuously scanning Active Directory against a database of over 4 billion breached passwords. Contact us for a free demo today .

"Network Security Vulnerability Cisco has confirmed that a Chinese threat actor known as Salt Typhoon gained access by likely abusing a known security flaw tracked as CVE20180171 , and by obtaining legitimate victim login credentials as part of a targeted campaign aimed at major U.S. telecommunications companies. The threat actor then demonstrated their ability to persist in target environments across equipment from multiple vendors for extended periods, maintaining access in one instance for over three years, Cisco Talos said , describing the hackers as highly sophisticated and wellfunded. The long timeline of this campaign suggests a high degree of coordination, planning, and patience standard hallmarks of advanced persistent threat APT and statesponsored actors. The networking equipment major said it found no evidence that other known security bugs have been weaponized by the hacking crew, contrary to a recent report from Recorded Future that revealed exploitation attempts involving flaws tracked as CVE202320198 and CVE202320273 to infiltrate networks. An important aspect of the campaign is the use of valid, stolen credentials to gain initial access, although the manner in which they are acquired is unknown at this stage. The threat actor has also been observed making efforts to get hold of credentials via network device configurations and deciphering local accounts with weak password types. In addition, we have observed the threat actor capturing SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS traffic, including the secret keys used between network devices and TACACSRADIUS servers, Talos noted. The intent of this traffic capture is almost certainly to enumerate additional credential details for followon use. Another noteworthy behavior exhibited by Salt Typhoon entails leveraging livingofftheland LOTL techniques on network devices, abusing the trusted infrastructure as pivot points to jump from one telecom to another. Its suspected that these devices are being used as intermediate relays to reach the intended final target or as a first hop for outbound data exfiltration operations, as it offers a way for the adversary to remain undetected for extended periods of time. Furthermore, Salt Typhoon has been spotted altering network configurations to create local accounts, enable Guest Shell access, and facilitate remote access via SSH. Also put to use is a bespoke utility named JumbledPath that allows them to execute a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actordefined jumphost. The Gobased ELF binary is also capable of clearing logs and disabling logging in an attempt to obfuscate traces of the malicious activity and make forensic analysis more difficult. This is supplemented by periodic steps undertaken to erase relevant logs, including .bash_history, auth.log, lastlog, wtmp, and btmp, where applicable. The use of this utility would help to obfuscate the original source, and ultimate destination, of the request and would also allow its operator to move through potentially otherwise nonpubliclyreachable or routable devices or infrastructure, Cisco noted. The threat actor repeatedly modified the address of the loopback interface on a compromised switch and used that interface as the source of SSH connections to additional devices within the target environment, allowing them to effectively bypass access control lists ACLs in place on those devices. The company said it also identified additional pervasive targeting of Cisco devices with exposed Smart Install SMI, followed by the exploitation of CVE20180171. The activity, it pointed out, is unrelated to Salt Typhoon and does not share overlaps with any known threat actor or group. Found this article interesting?
